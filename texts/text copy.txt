# Tibetan Text Translation

From Volume One of the Collected Works [gsung rab glegs bam] of Master Ratnakīrti [rin po che bsod nams rtse mo], who was renowned as a Great Paṇḍita of the Five Sciences, this is "A General Presentation of the Classes of Tantra."

Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ!

I bow respectfully with my crown to the feet of the holy venerable guru Bhaṭṭāraka.
I bow to glorious Vajrasattva.

Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ!

I bow respectfully with my crown to the feet of the holy venerable master.
I bow to glorious Vajrasattva.

This is bound with the prasthāra obtained from verse 2,438 among the 16,384 verses of the powerful fourteen-fold meter of equal composition, realized through wondrous understanding.

Lord of all, protector of beings, glorious chief Vajradhara,
Who assumed an ordinary form to train those of lesser minds,
According to their fortune, ripening them through limitless body, speech and mind—
I bow with joined palms at my crown to the guru's feet.

Through whose compassion, in wrathful form,
With the radiance of a hundred thousand suns illuminating non-dual meaning,
By merely saying "HŪṂ" dispels all obstacles—
I pray for protection from the steadfast hero wielding the vajra.

The distinctions of tantras to be attained and means of attainment
Following the Dharma in accord with the guru's words,
Delighting those who enjoy elaboration,
Are clearly explained elsewhere through understanding of scripture's meaning.

Here, for those who seek understanding with minimal elaboration...

Here, for those who seek understanding with minimal elaboration,
Following with faith the guru's words alone,
Taking scripture as chief for its meaning's sake—
I shall write a brief presentation of the classes of tantra.

Though already clarified well by the learned ones,
To increase understanding in self and others and familiarize with excellent explanations,
Like when fledgling birds still learning to fly
Train even before their wings are fully developed,

Since most beings endowed with understanding will engage after knowing the distinctions between the object to be focused upon, the result to be attained, and the path that accomplishes attainment,

It is appropriate to first present this general exposition at the beginning of the classes of tantra. Then, to demonstrate how this path is superior to others, the meaning of the tantras' names follows. To help those of lesser intellect easily understand such a superior path, after that come the oral instructions on methods for explaining tantra. Then, having properly understood the meaning of tantra, to show how it develops in the mindstream when put into practice, the manifest realization of tantra follows thereafter.

These four approaches should be understood as: the entrance way traveled by the wise from the writings of the great master of yoga Virūpa; the lamp illuminating all tantras; the stairway to the city of nirvāṇa difficult to understand for those lacking merit; and that which possesses all supreme aspects.

Regarding the first, the general presentation has two parts:

The first general presentation has two parts:

1. The presentation of the object of focus or result to be attained
2. The presentation of the path that accomplishes attainment along with its divisions

Regarding the first, in general, the ultimate object of focus or result to be attained is solely the single result called "the state of unsurpassed perfect and complete buddhahood. " This has two parts:

1. Explaining the characteristics
2. Establishing it as singular

Regarding the first, what are the characteristics of buddhahood? They are three:
1. Understanding the nature of reality without error
2. Possessing perfect uncontaminated bliss 
3. Being free from all obscuring stains

That this is so can be known from scripture:
"I am Buddha due to understanding things. "
"Completely awakened due to understanding bliss. "
"Buddhahood is freedom from obscurations like Brahma. "

Among these three, first, "being free from obscurations" is the cause. The obscurations are three:
1. Afflictive obscurations like anger that obstruct omniscience of all phenomena
2. Cognitive obscurations that obstruct understanding things as they are
3. Meditative absorption obscurations

These three comprise all obscurations. "Freedom" means complete freedom. Thus there is perfect abandonment, like awakening from sleep - this is the meaning of "Buddha. " Through attaining such a state, one understands both conventional phenomena and their ultimate nature. This is the dharmakāya of inseparable basic space and primordial wisdom, realized through understanding profound dependent origination.

Through attaining such a state, what is called "understanding bliss" refers to possessing immeasurable buddha qualities such as enlightened form, primordial wisdom and so forth - this is called the bliss of complete liberation. Thus these two, like a fully bloomed lotus with mind opened and expanded, constitute the meaning of the term "Buddha. " This is perfect primordial wisdom. In this way, each of these three individually implies all other qualities indirectly. Although many characteristics of buddhahood are taught in numerous sūtras, tantras, treatises and commentaries, here only these three are explained. This is based solely on what the holy guru taught from the Second Investigation and the Saṃpuṭa Tantra. Through this, one should understand that all characteristics and qualities of buddhahood are included. Regarding the second point of establishing the ultimate result as singular, there are two parts:
1. The reasoning establishing it as singular
2. Dispelling objections to that

Regarding the first, although there are many divergent paths in general, there is only one ultimate destination. As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:
"Because through many dharmas,
Like rivers flowing to the ocean,
Liberation itself is singular—
Many goals are not conceived. "

And from the Uttaratantra, using the metaphor of rivers and ocean as examples for both sides, it states: "For example, when many rivers flow into the great ocean, there is no opportunity for them to appear separately. " This establishes that although there are many philosophical systems, there is only one nature of reality, and although there are many paths, there is only one ultimate destination. Furthermore, since the ultimate result is understanding the nature of reality, and since the nature of reality is not multiple, the ultimate is also not multiple.

Moreover, "being singular" means being of one kind in terms of perfect abandonment and primordial wisdom, not like merging into the Self as taught by non-Buddhist philosophers where things become one in essence. 2. Dispelling objections to that has two parts:
1. Dispelling the fault of there being multiple philosophical systems
2. Dispelling the fault regarding the teaching of three vehicles

Regarding the first: If one thinks there must be multiple natures of reality since multiple philosophical systems appear, like the Self taught by non-Buddhists and so forth, [this is incorrect]. The appearance of multiplicity is merely conceptually imputed by those who have not realized the ultimate. For those who have realized, there is nothing whatsoever apart from profound dependent origination. For example, although various rivers appear outside the ocean, they become one taste when merging with it. Or like how a single sun disk appears differently due to different locations. Or like how a hundred blind men touching an elephant each experience different sensations. 2. Regarding dispelling the fault of teaching three vehicles: One might wonder, "How should we interpret the Blessed One's teaching of three types of enlightenment corresponding to the three types of beings?"

That was taught temporarily as a provisional path result in order to lead those of lesser capacity. This establishes the single vehicle doctrine and is called the view of realization. Since generating bodhicitta is the beginning of the path, this is taught first to make it clear. All treatises that establish the meaning of reality, like the Madhyamaka treatises and so forth, clarify this meaning.

These can be understood in detail in those [texts]. From the General Presentation of Tantra Classes, this is the first chapter establishing the ultimate fruition that is the object to be focused on at the start of all paths. The presentation of the path for attaining that has five parts:
1. The essential nature of the path
2. The divisions of that path
3. The characteristics of each division
4. How the Vajrayāna vehicle is superior to the Pāramitāyāna
5. Specific analysis of the Vajrayāna vehicle

The first has two parts:
1. The definition of the path
2. Its divisions

First, [the definition]: It is the means for attaining one's respective objects of focus. The divisions are two:
1. Common paths
2. Uncommon paths

The first has three:
1. Paths that lead to lower realms
2. Paths that merely attain higher realms
3. Paths that merely attain liberation

1. The first refers to some inferior non-Buddhist philosophers who hold nihilistic views and so forth. 2. Those that merely attain higher realms are the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers like the Jainas and others. 3. Those that merely attain liberation are the paths of the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. The second general topic regarding the uncommon path has two parts:
1. The purpose of teaching the common path
2. The characteristics of the unique Mahāyāna

Regarding the first: If one wonders "Why teach the common path when the uncommon path alone would suffice?", there are three purposes:
1. To guide various types of beings by those following the Mahāyāna
2. To remove doubts about the path by understanding what accords and does not accord with it
3. To refute those who claim to practice the Mahāyāna without having developed even the common path.

First, regarding the divisions of beings' spiritual dispositions, the Uttaratantra states there are three types:
1. Those who desire existence
2. Those who desire freedom from existence
3. Those who desire neither of these

The meaning of this is:
1. Those who desire existence are some inferior non-Buddhist philosophers
2. Those who desire peace are of two types:
   2.1. Those unskilled in methods
   2.2. Those skilled in methods
The unskilled in methods are the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers, while the skilled are the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas.
3. The third type, those who view existence and peace equally, are the bodhisattvas. As stated in the Bodhicaryāvatāra:
"Free from the extremes of attachment and destruction,
They remain accomplished while dwelling in saṃsāra."

Thus, after teaching their respective paths to these three types, they are ultimately led to the Mahāyāna. With this intention it was stated: "There is nothing that a bodhisattva should not learn."

2. Removing doubts about the path by understanding what accords and does not accord with it means: By understanding all paths, one discerns the distinctions between phenomena and, realizing one's own path as supreme, abandons attention to other paths.

3. Refuting those who claim to practice the Mahāyāna without having developed even the common path means: Some individuals who haven't even developed the mindset of supreme non-Buddhist philosophers arrogantly claim "I am a Mahāyāna practitioner." For them, there is the purpose of understanding the meaning of Mahāyāna by recognizing "This path is mine, that path belongs to others." Therefore, the common path must be taught.

The second part regarding the characteristics of the unique Mahāyāna has three parts:

1. First, regarding the nature of the unique path: It is the means of the Mahāyāna for attaining the result of omniscience. 2. There are four ways in which it is superior to the common paths:
   2. 1. Superior through engaging in methods to eliminate suffering
   2. 2. Superior through having no attachment to saṃsāra
   2. 3. Superior through entering the Buddha vehicle as the method for liberation
   2. 4. Superior through entering the Mahāyāna which teaches the inseparability of emptiness and compassion as the path of equality between existence and peace, not merely desiring liberation

2. 1. Regarding engaging in methods to eliminate suffering, there are two:
   2. 1. 1. Eliminating suffering of this life
   2. 1. 2. Eliminating suffering of future lives

2. 1. 1. The first refers to engaging in what is taught in treatises on proper conduct and so forth. Through this, one is superior to the ignorant like cowherds who have not entered any philosophical system. 2. 1. 2. Eliminating suffering of future lives means developing the path to higher realms in one's mindstream through confidence in karma and its results. Through this, one is superior to those with wrong views like the nihilists and others who hold inferior philosophical systems. 2. 2. Second, having no attachment to saṃsāra means thinking: "Alas! Although I wish to eliminate suffering, if I do not abandon this saṃsāra, I will not be freed from suffering. Therefore, I must attain liberation. " This is the mindset of abandoning all worldly paths. While the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers may also have some semblance of such a mindset, they have still not entered the actual methods for liberation.

2. 3. Regarding entering the Buddha vehicle as the method for liberation, there are two parts:
1. Taking refuge in the Three Jewels
2. Accepting the four seals of the Buddha's teaching

1. First, by taking refuge in the Buddha, one abandons worldly teachers like Īśvara and others, and abandons aspiring to their attainments. By taking refuge in the Dharma, one abandons worldly paths that harm sentient beings along with their basis. By taking refuge in the Saṅgha, one abandons association with non-Buddhist practitioners. Moreover, by taking refuge itself, one accepts the four seals of the Buddha's teaching:
1. All conditioned phenomena are impermanent
2. All contaminated phenomena are suffering
3. All transcendence of suffering is peace and bliss
4. All phenomena are selfless

If one takes refuge in the Three Jewels but does not accept the four seals, one is still considered a Buddhist, like the Śrāvaka Sthiramati. If some claim "The Blessed One stated that such a person is not a Buddhist," then by that logic, since it is stated "Those who do not assert all phenomena as lacking inherent existence are not my disciples," even the Cittamātrins and others would not be Buddhists. Through these [qualities], one is distinguished from all non-Buddhist philosophers. 2. 4. "Entering specifically into the Mahāyāna itself" means: Through engaging in abandoning suffering in the way previously explained, one is distinguished from those who have not entered any philosophical system. Through holding the Three Jewels, one is distinguished from non-Buddhists.

Through engaging in the equality of existence and peace, one is distinguished from Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. If one asks how this is superior to the Śrāvakas, there are three points:
1. Distinctions between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of scriptures or philosophical tenets
2. Distinctions between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of path and result
3. The rationale for establishing these separate distinctions regarding scriptures and path-result

1. First, the twelve branches of scripture and seven Abhidharma treatises and so forth that are well-known among the Śrāvakas who hold philosophical tenets and have pride in their Abhidharma are called the Śrāvaka scriptures. The vast scriptures unknown to them, such as the Prajñāpāramitā and extensive Vaipulya sūtras, are called the Mahāyāna scriptures. Although there are infinite detailed distinctions between these two, 

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states:
"Five dharmas and three natures,
Eight types of consciousness,
And the two types of selflessness—
All of Mahāyāna is contained within these. "

The five dharmas are:
1. Names
2. Reasons
3. Conceptualization 
4. Suchness
5. Perfect wisdom

The three natures are:
1. The imagined
2. The dependent
3. The perfect

The eight consciousnesses are:
1. The six collections beginning with eye consciousness
2. The afflicted mind
3. The foundational consciousness

The two types of selflessness are:
1. Selflessness of persons
2. Selflessness of phenomena

These teachings are the Mahāyāna texts. Other masters like Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga have taught many other distinctions that should be investigated elsewhere.

2. Regarding the distinction between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of path and result, the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra states:

"Because it possesses seven greatnesses:
1. Greatness of focus
2. Likewise two accomplishments
3. Wisdom and diligence in undertaking
4. Skillful means
5. Great perfect accomplishment
6. Great enlightened activity of buddhas
Therefore it is definitively called the Great Vehicle."

Among these, the first five are paths, being that by which one travels. The latter two are results, being where one arrives - the great purpose for oneself and others. Although many different ways of establishing these distinctions have been taught, know that they are all included within these. These also are included within the two: great compassion and great wisdom. Therefore, the Great Vehicle is ultimate in terms of both scriptures and path-result.

3. If one thinks: "Wouldn't it be sufficient to show the distinction between these two through either scriptures or philosophical tenets alone? Why are path and result needed? Or conversely, wouldn't explaining path and result be sufficient?" This is not so.

The distinctions of scriptures and philosophical tenets were made to refute the Śrāvaka schools who claim that their own extensive collections alone are the Mahāyāna and that other texts like the Prajñāpāramitā were not spoken by the Buddha. Therefore, this also relates to establishing the Mahāyāna as Buddha's word. Furthermore, the distinctions of path and result were taught to dispel the wrong view of some Mahāyānists who think that once one enters these scriptures, one will definitely not become a Śrāvaka or Pratyekabuddha. Although they hold Mahāyāna philosophical tenets

Since they hold Mahāyāna philosophical tenets but do not possess the seven great qualities, they will become Śrāvakas. 3. Regarding the third general point about special distinctions, there are four divisions:
1. Those who assert three results from three paths
2. Those who assert three results from one path  
3. Those who assert one result from one path
4. Those who assert one result from three paths

The first position is held by Ācārya Asaṅga and others, who maintain that through the Śrāvaka scriptures one attains the state of an Arhat or Pratyekabuddha, while through Mahāyāna scriptures one attains buddhahood. They teach that even within the Mahāyāna, paths for all three types of spiritual dispositions are taught, since it is explained that if one strays from the path, one will become a Śrāvaka or Pratyekabuddha. The second position is held by Ācārya Candrakīrti, who maintains that through Śrāvaka philosophical tenets one cannot even attain arhatship. Although all three types are liberated through Mahāyāna philosophical tenets, he considers the Śrāvaka philosophical tenets to be merely provisional meaning within the Mahāyāna. The third position is held by some who maintain that by relying on the Mahāyāna path, one temporarily accomplishes one result and ultimately attains enlightenment. The fourth position is held by some masters following the White Lotus Sutra and other teachings. Using the example of the householder, they explain that temporarily one is established on three paths but ultimately attains enlightenment. As stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra:

"Having attained the body of samādhi,
One does not attain enlightenment for an eon. Like a drunken person
Who becomes sober when the intoxication wears off,
Similarly, they attain what is called
My buddha-body and dharma. "

Since this approach and the position asserting one result from one path are essentially the same, I too find this position acceptable.

The first two approaches are established through scripture and reasoning. Thus, regarding the nature of the path itself, it is termed the Mahāyāna possessing four special qualities. These approaches are explained extensively in the Yuktiṣaṣṭikā, Ratnāvalī, Mahāyānottaratantra, Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi and other texts, so they should be understood from those sources. Although this presentation of the nature of the path itself is not taught by the venerable guru here, it is written from what he taught elsewhere, as it is relevant to this context. How is it relevant? When making divisions of the path here, without a general [classification of] path, the basis of division would not be established and the divisions would not be elegant. Furthermore, without understanding the general [nature of] Mahāyāna, which includes both Secret Mantra and Pāramitā, misconceptions would arise. Indeed, here in the Land of Snows, we see some practitioners of Secret Mantra and some who claim to be Mahāyāna Śrāvakas narrowly conceiving of Mahāyāna itself and carelessly treating the tantric texts. Therefore, to dispel such misconceptions, the basis of division is explained in this context. This was the second chapter, on the nature of the path itself, from the General Presentation of the Classes of Tantra. 2. Regarding the divisions of the path, there are four topics:
1. Basis of division
2. Meaning of the divisions
3. Determining the number
4. Etymology

1. The first is the Mahāyāna as explained above, in terms of both scriptural systems and path-result. This is the basis of division. When divided, there are two:
1. Pāramitāyāna
2. Mantrayāna.

The Mahāyāna that lacks these four special qualities is called the Pāramitāyāna, while that which is distinguished by the four special qualities is called the Mantrayāna. These two paths are not mutually exclusive or contradictory divisions, but rather divisions of general and specific, or superior and non-superior. Here, the general is the Pāramitāyāna, as it comprises the paths common to both. The specific is the Vajrayāna, as it is superior due to its profound and vast qualities not found in the other. The distinctions between these two will be explained in detail below. This was regarding the meaning of the divisions. 3. Regarding the third point of establishing the definitive number as two, there are two parts:
1. Establishing two paths
2. Establishing two results

Each of these has two aspects:
1. Through reasoning
2. Through scripture

Regarding the first, the logical reasoning for establishing the definitive number of paths as two is that since all dharmas are taught for the sake of disciples as the basis to be trained, there are two types of disciples:

Generally, for those with lesser afflictions and specifically those with little attachment to desires and who wish to attain enlightenment by abandoning these, who are of lesser faculties, the Pāramitāyāna was taught. For certain individuals who generally have greater afflictions and specifically have great attachment to desires which they cannot abandon, yet who wish to attain unsurpassed enlightenment and who have sharp faculties, the Mantrayāna was taught. If you think: "Since Secret Mantra was taught to those with greater afflictions, and since having greater afflictions is inferior, wouldn't that mean Secret Mantra is not superior?".

This is not an inferior path just because it was taught for those with greater afflictions. Being inferior means being unable to apply the antidote. Moreover, it is actually a greater method precisely because it conquers those greater afflictions. As stated in the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra:

"For those endowed with great methods,
Afflictions become factors of enlightenment. Because saṃsāra has the nature of peace,
The bodhisattvas are thus inconceivable. "

This is like how a small fire cannot be used with large fuel, but when the fire is large, even a large amount of fuel becomes a support for the flames. If one thinks: "If both Pāramitāyāna and Secret Mantra have methods for all three types of disciples - those with greater, medium and lesser afflictions - what is the point of making distinctions?" It is not contradictory that there are subdivisions within each. Thus, since there are definitively two types of disciples, the paths are also definitively established as two. 2. Establishing through scripture: As stated in the Samyaksambodhisūtra: "This Mahāyāna is indeed the Great Vehicle - the path of bodhisattvas together with its result. Therefore, it is established in the Pāramitā sūtras through the seven types of greatness. This Vajrayāna, which is even more extraordinary, becomes supreme in qualities since it accomplishes buddhahood and so forth in this very life. "

Also, Ācārya Buddhaguhya stated in the Piṇḍārtha of the Vairocana-abhisambodhi: "The accomplishment of perfect purpose for self and others is taught through Secret Mantra conduct and through the sūtras that teach Pāramitā conduct. ".

2. Regarding the second general point - the definite existence of two results - there are two parts:

1. Through reasoning
2. Through scripture

1. The reasoning is: It is natural that when there is a distinction in the cause, there will be a distinction in the result. For example, like kautapa and śāli rice. Therefore, since there are two paths, there will also be two results. 2. Regarding scripture: As stated in the Samyaksambodhisūtra: "In this birth, one will attain either buddhahood or vajrasattvahood. Those who have not attained the inconceivable state are sugatas, who are buddhas. The actual subject indicated is the authentic Vajrasattva. "

This shows that the result of the Pāramitāyāna is not having obtained all abandonments and attainments, while the result of Vajrayāna is actualizing everything. This should be understood in detail through scripture and reasoning. The meanings of the names of these two paths are:
1. That which teaches Pāramitā conduct
2. That which teaches Secret Mantra conduct

Or alternatively:
1. The Great Vehicle in general
2. The Vajra Vehicle

The various synonyms like "Bodhisattva Collection" and "Vidyādhara Collection" should be understood as applying specific names to general categories. A general name refers to just the general category, while a specific name refers to a particular instance within that category. For example, it is like distinguishing between "copper" and "copper pot. "

How do we know this is so? As stated in the Vajraśekhara:
"The practice of the six perfections
Is explained by the Teacher as conceptual. "

Also, in the Mother of the Victorious Ones (Prajñāpāramitā), it states: "The perfection of wisdom is secret mantra, called the secret mantra of great awareness" and so forth. Therefore, these names are given based on what is predominant.

These are also known as:
1. The vehicle that abandons the basis and the vehicle that does not abandon the basis
2. The causal vehicle and the resultant vehicle
3. The common Mahāyāna and the uncommon Mahāyāna

These are specific, definitive names. The explanation of the literal meaning of these names will be explained in the section on their individual characteristics. This was the third chapter from the general presentation of the tantra collections, concerning the detailed classification of paths. Having understood the detailed classification of paths, in order to make this clear, the characteristics of each path will now be explained. First, we will present the system of the Pāramitāyāna path, since it is the foundation of the path and is common. After that, we will present the system of Secret Mantra, since it teaches what is superior to that. The first has four parts:
1. Establishing the basis by which one becomes either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa
2. Teaching how to make the path by abandoning the basis
3. Presenting the system of the Pāramitāyāna path
4. Incidentally establishing it as the causal vehicle while teaching the time of accomplishing the result through that path

The first has two parts:
1. The characteristics of the basis
2. Establishing how that basis is the common cause of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa

Regarding the first, while the term "basis" generally applies to five aspects - cause, condition, prerequisites, antecedents, and support - here it refers to the conditional cause. What is this cause? While extensively it can be divided into many categories like aggregates, elements, sense-bases and so forth, when condensed it is the five sensual pleasures.

How are they condensed into five? While mind is the agent of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and its objects are the six or twelve sense objects, since all of these are included within just these five and what follows from them, these five are the basis.

2. Regarding the second point - whether this basis is common to both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa or specific to each - it is common. One might think: "Since those desiring nirvāṇa must abandon the basis, how can it be common?"

Although abandonment is true, the very objects of abandonment must be taken as objects, and thus they are established as the basis for nirvāṇa as well. As stated in the Abhidharma: "These themselves are the basis for discourse in time, along with definite emergence and basis." And: "Suffering, origin, the world, divine abodes and existence are also these."

Regarding how this first acts as the basis for saṃsāra: First, one experiences objects. Not knowing their nature there, attachment arises through grasping to self and mine. Based on that, various conceptual thoughts arise - this is called ignorance, craving and grasping. These are the afflictive defilements. Based on those, performing virtuous and non-virtuous actions is formation and becoming. These two are the karmic defilements. From that, the seven factors of consciousness, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, feeling, birth, and aging-and-death are suffering - the defilements of birth. Thus the twelve links of existence revolve through the three defilements. As stated in the Lalitavistara:

Through the power of craving, becoming and ignorance, beings
Circle through the three realms of humans, gods and bad migrations,
Not knowing the five destinies they wander,
Like a potter's wheel turning round and round. How does this become the basis for nirvāṇa? First, one experiences objects. Then through analyzing them, one knows their nature. Through that, attachment does not arise. Through that, ignorance ceases. Therefore, one does not create karma. When karma is not created, the afflictive defilements of birth do not arise and gradually cease. As stated in the Madhyamaka:

"Through the cessation of ignorance,
Through meditation on reality with wisdom,
Through the cessation of this and that,
This and that will not manifest. "

Therefore, it depends on one's own knowledge and ignorance. The objects themselves do not inherently determine whether they become a basis for saṃsāra or nirvāṇa. For example, it is like: whichever weapon is stronger in battle; or how a śleṣa flower smells fragrant when eaten by a white elephant but foul when eaten by a black elephant; or how milk becomes nectar for humans but poison for snakes; or how a jewel can be an ornament when whole but not when broken - it depends on conditions. Therefore, as stated in the Glorious Hevajra Tantra:

"Thus the five qualities
That are desired in saṃsāra
Become poison when impure,
But like nectar when pure. "

This explains the basis. Regarding the second general point - how the Pāramitāyāna makes the path by abandoning the basis - there are two parts:
1. Viewing objects as unfavorable
2. The method of abandoning them

1. When one properly examines the sufferings of saṃsāra, one becomes disenchanted.

When one becomes disenchanted and investigates "From what cause did this suffering arise?", one finds it arises from karma. That arises from afflictive emotions. Those afflictive emotions arise in dependence on objects. Therefore, one develops the perception that objects are unfavorable, thinking "Objects are the cause of suffering. " Furthermore, it is taught in many ways that "Objects are insatiable" and so forth. As stated in the sūtras: "Desires are like poisonous leaves" and so forth. Also from the Letter to a Student:

"Objects are like poison - initially pleasant when experienced,
Objects are like poison - their ripening is harsh and unbearable, 
Objects are like poison - they envelope one in the darkness of delusion,
Objects are like poison - difficult to reverse and deceptive. "

Through contemplating their unfavorable nature in many such ways, one develops the perception that freedom from desire is happiness. 2. Regarding the actual method of abandoning the basis:

First of all, being afraid of saṃsāra, one goes for refuge in the Three Jewels and takes vows of moral discipline to abandon [negative actions]. After that, through hearing reliable scripture and reasoning, one comes to understand the nature of objects through contemplation. Subsequently, through meditation one abandons all attachment to objects. This has two parts:
1. Meditation on the conventional level
2. Meditation on the ultimate level 

1. For those with predominant attachment, one meditates on unattractiveness. For those with predominant conceptual thought, one practices breath counting, following the breath, and so forth. For those with anger, one practices loving-kindness and so forth to stabilize the mind. After that, as an antidote to the four mistaken views - seeing things as pure, pleasant, permanent and having self - one should meditate on the four foundations of mindfulness, and so forth.

2. For meditation on the ultimate level, one abandons [attachment] by meditating on all phenomena as lacking inherent nature. As stated:

"Desires, riches, and the three realms of existence,
The Victor taught are like illusions, mirages, moon reflections in water, and magical creations."

This completes the explanation of the method of abandoning the basis.

If one wonders "Since even śrāvakas have this path of merely abandoning the basis, how is the Pāramitāyāna superior?", it is true that in general the earlier paths are mostly common, while the later ones are superior. Thus, while merely abandoning the basis is common to both Pāramitāyāna and śrāvakas, the Mahāyāna is superior through its view and conduct as explained earlier.

3. The systematic presentation of the Pāramitāyāna path has two parts:
1. Presentation of the nature of the path itself
2. The way of developing direct realizations of that path

1. Regarding the first, what is the nature of the path itself? While there are inconceivable different ways of presenting the path, 

here it is condensed into what are called the six pāramitās - conduct motivated by great compassion. When divided according to the practice of the Prajñāpāramitā, these become the ten pāramitās. As stated in the Madhyāntavibhāga:

"Generosity, discipline, patience, diligence,
Meditation and wisdom, method,
Aspiration, power and pristine wisdom - 
These are accepted as the ten pāramitās."

These ten [pāramitās] have innumerable presentations such as their divisions, the three trainings, condensation into the two accumulations, and so forth, which should be sought elsewhere. 2. How do direct realizations of this path arise? As stated in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra, there are ten stages:

"The [spiritually mature] lineage and faith in the Dharma,
Likewise generating bodhicitta,
Practicing generosity and so forth,
Engaging in what is flawless,
Bringing beings to maturity,
Purifying the buddha-field,
Non-abiding nirvāṇa,
Supreme enlightenment and teaching. "

Also, four stages are taught:
"Attaining the grounds through faith,
Engaging in conduct,
For realization, and
Fourth, through accomplishment of the grounds. "

By the term "grounds" one should understand everything explained earlier such as generating bodhicitta, the pāramitās and so forth. First arises what is called the cause of being fortunate - the [spiritually mature] lineage. Then, motivated by compassion, one takes refuge in the Three Jewels and develops faith in the Dharma. Then arises the foundation for engaging in conduct - generating bodhicitta. Then arises the actual practice of the pāramitās. These four constitute the ground of acting through faith. Then comes what is called "bodhisattvas engaging in what is flawless" - attaining the first ground. Then comes "bringing beings to maturity" up through the seventh ground. Then "purifying the field" and "non-abiding nirvāṇa" constitute the three irreversible grounds. These are the path. Then comes enlightenment - manifesting perfect enlightenment and teaching the great nirvāṇa. Working for the benefit of beings is the fruit.

Thus, through conduct that is completely pure in the three spheres, one progresses to buddhahood through the six pāramitās, hence it is called "pāramitā." Moreover, it is called a "vehicle" (yāna) because one travels by this path, or because one travels to this result. 

If one asks "How long does it take to accomplish the result through this path?", for the sharpest it takes three countless eons, for the middling thirty-six, and for the lowest an inconceivable number. Therefore, since the cause takes a long time, it is labeled "causal vehicle." This is like calling someone with a slow gait "gaitless." 

Alternatively, it is called a "cause" because presently there is not even a similarity to the result - through causes like welcoming the guru and so forth, one accomplishes different results like having the marks of wheels on hands and feet. This is like calling a sprout "the cause of barley." That is sufficient elaboration.

The result accomplished through this path is as explained above.

This completes the explanation of the systematic presentation of the Pāramitāyāna, the common path.

Now, regarding the systematic presentation of the second path, there are four parts:
1. The way of not abandoning the basis
2. The systematic presentation of secret mantra conduct 
3. The systematic presentation of Vajrayāna
4. An ancillary explanation of the systematic presentation of the resultant vehicle along with teaching the time of accomplishing the result

The first has three parts:
1. The reasoning for not abandoning the basis
2. The methods for not abandoning
3. The way of becoming liberated from that

Regarding the first, the basis was explained earlier as the five sensual pleasures. Since these themselves are the basis and the objects, how can they be abandoned? Moreover, even those who are greatly afflicted cannot abandon them, so they should not be abandoned. Therefore, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:

Thus, how could those who are greatly afflicted abandon them? They should not be abandoned. Therefore, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:

"The worldly beings produced by desire
Will be liberated through desire itself. "

And as stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"Those with desire, through wisdom and desire,
Should always rely on the five sensual pleasures. "

If one asks "Won't one be bound by the objects?", those without method will be bound, like ordinary beings. But for those with method, those very things become aids to liberation, like poison or fire and so forth. Therefore, objects do not bind by their own nature - it is conceptual confusion dependent on them that binds. Thus, by abandoning the cause of bondage in its own nature, one is liberated, and the objects that were conditions for bondage become conditions for liberation. As stated in the glorious Hevajra:

"Whatever binds beings
To their terrible karma,
That very thing, when combined with method,
Liberates from the bonds of existence. "

If one asks what is this method mentioned in "combined with method" that abandons the causes of bondage, the second part - the methods for not abandoning the basis - has two parts:
1. Skill in the methods of generation stage
2. Skill in the methods of completion stage

The first has two parts:
1. Skill in the methods of one's special personal deity
2. Skill in the methods of individual deities

Regarding the first, one recognizes whatever objects and subjects appear as one's single deity and enjoys them. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"All desired enjoyments
Should be enjoyed as desired,
Through union with one's deity,
Make offerings to self and others. "

Similarly, this is taught in other texts as well.

That is for transforming ordinary conceptual thoughts for those who prefer concise practice. 2. Regarding skill in the methods of individual deities, one makes infinite divisions of objects and subjects, and recognizes each of these individually as deities. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"In brief, the five aggregates are the Victors,
They are all the Tathāgatas. These vajra sense fields too
Are the supreme maṇḍala of bodhisattvas. "

And as stated in the glorious Hevajra:

"Form is renowned as Gaurī,
Sound's aspect is Caurī. "

This destroys all ordinary grasping and conceptual thoughts of grasping things as whole entities for those who delight in elaborate practice. Thus, the cause of bondage is ordinary conceptual thought. When one recognizes these as deities, ordinary perception ceases and everything is gradually abandoned. 2. Regarding skill in the methods of completion stage, relying on whatever method is appropriate, one gives rise to non-conceptual samādhi, and through that transforms the colors of objects and enjoys them. As stated in the Later Guhyasamāja Tantra:

"Through the yoga of completion stage
Arising from method and wisdom,
The mantrin should definitely practice yoga
With aggregates, elements, sense fields and forms. "

Thus, since the cause of bondage is conceptual thought, by clearing away concepts through non-conceptual samādhi, all bonds are gradually released. 3. Regarding the way of becoming liberated from that: In general, the cause of bondage is mere conceptual thought, and specifically ordinary conceptual thought.

By relying on that, afflictions and so forth arise gradually. Therefore, through these two methods, when one clears away the causes in their own essence, objects transform their colors and become aids to the antidote, so one relies on objects as in the previous example. As stated in the Second Stage:

"Having made these pure and free from poison,
One should rely upon these very objects."

At first, the antidote is weak and objects are harmful, appearing as enemies. Similarly, through reliance, in the middle when their powers are equal, sometimes harm and sometimes benefit arise - this is called the time of variegated appearances. These two receive the name "meditative equipoise." Finally, when the antidote becomes powerful, objects aid realization.

At that point, it is called the time when appearances arise as spiritual friends. This is called "the five poisons becoming medicine." Since samādhi arises continuously, it is called "perfect equipoise." As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:

"Whatever sense faculty and path,
That becomes its very nature.
Through yoga without equipoise,
There is always perfect equipoise."

And it speaks of continuous yoga in verses like "Various forms in the belly..." 

2. Regarding the second meaning: This very method of not abandoning the basis as explained above is called Mantra practice. How is it Mantra practice? 1. What is the meaning of mantra and 2. What is its practice. 

1. Regarding the first, there are five parts:
1.1 What is the general cause of mantras arising
1.2 What are mantra words
1.3 The meaning of mantras
1.4 The divisions of mantras
1.5 The etymology of mantras

The etymology of mantra, or the explanation of its verbal meaning, should be understood extensively elsewhere. Here, for now, the ultimate meaning of mantra is that it protects the mind from characteristics and conceptual thoughts, and its corresponding practice is the samaya of the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. As stated in the latter part of the glorious Guhyasamāja Tantra:

"From the conditions of faculties and objects,
Whatever arises in the mind is called 'man. '
'Tra' means that which protects. What is explained as freedom from worldly conduct
Is the samaya commitment. Protected by all vajras,
This is explained as mantra practice. "

And from the Dbang yon tan rim pa:

"The verbal meaning of mantra is explained as
Non-dual emptiness and compassion:
'Emptiness and compassion itself,
Non-dual and the way of two,
From that is explained as secret mantra. '"

All other explanations taught in the Vajraśekhara and elsewhere should be understood elsewhere. 3. This very [practice] is called the Vajrayāna because:

Here, vajra refers to the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. Yāna means "that by which one travels," referring to the path, and "where one travels to," referring to the result. Regarding this, it is a yāna because one travels by means of the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. First, one generates bodhicitta similarly to the perfection [vehicle]. Then, at the time of entering the maṇḍala and receiving empowerment, the master consecrates the disciple's body, speech, and mind as the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas.

Then, without being separate from that, at the time of practicing the two stages of the path, one engages with the body, speech, and mind as the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. Then, by recognizing that the three - body, speech, and mind - and all afflictions are of vajra nature, this becomes progressively clearer and clearer - this is the path. When the result of the thirteenth bhūmi is accomplished from that, the actual realization of vajra body, speech, and mind is what one travels by, hence it is called a yāna. As stated in the Guhyasamāja:

"Desire, hatred, and delusion
Always abide delighting in the vajra. Therefore, the method of all buddhas
Is explained as the Vajrayāna. "

4. The presentation of the resultant vehicle:
When is this Vajrayāna accomplished? For superior individuals, it is accomplished in this very life. For middling ones, it is accomplished in the intermediate state. For inferior ones, in seven lifetimes. For the very inferior, it is accomplished within sixteen lifetimes. Regarding the first, from the Guhyasamāja:

"Through this great dharma nature,
Arising from the indivisible three kāyas,
Adorned by the ocean of wisdom,
It will be accomplished in this very life. "

Accomplishment in the intermediate state comes from the guru's speech. As stated in the Jñānabindu:

"Even those who lack diligence
Will accomplish it right after leaving the body. "

This shows accomplishment in the intermediate state right after leaving the body. Regarding accomplishment in seven lifetimes, from the Guhyagarbha:

"When given proper empowerment,
One will receive empowerment life after life. Through this, in seven lifetimes,
Accomplishment is gained even without meditation. "

Regarding accomplishment in sixteen lifetimes, from the Pañcasamaya:

"If one is without downfalls,
Accomplishment comes in sixteen lifetimes. ".

From the Vajraśekhara: 

"What cannot be attained through the perfections
Even in countless kalpas - 
If that yogin is diligent,
They will pass beyond suffering in this very life.
Or merely through seeing,
They will pass beyond in sixteen lives.
Even ordinary beings will accomplish
Buddhahood itself, not otherwise."

Therefore, since the result is accomplished with little difficulty, it is called the resultant vehicle. Alternatively, it is called the resultant vehicle because one meditates on the aspects of the result from the beginning, as stated in texts like "The five aspects of enlightenment, the virtuous essence of all buddhas..."

Thus, according to the Mantra system, the result along with its path is completely realized in a single instance right now. Therefore, it is called the resultant vehicle because it resembles the result, just as an extremely beautiful person is called a deity. This is the unique path.

4. This was the section on establishing the characteristics of individual paths from "The General Presentation of Tantra Classes."

Having thus explained the presentation of individual paths, I will now show how the conduct of Secret Mantra is superior in terms of special timing.

Regarding how it is superior in terms of special timing, as stated by Master Kṛṣṇapāda in the Nayatrayapradīpa:

"Though the meaning is one, it is superior
Due to lack of confusion, many methods,
Absence of hardship, and being for those
Of sharp faculties."

This has three parts:
1. Teaching that the meaning to be realized is one

1. Teaching that the meaning to be realized is one, 2. The actual way in which the method of realization is superior, and 3. Dispelling objections to this.

Regarding the first, there is no difference in the ultimate nature (dharmadhātu) to be realized, the result of buddhahood to be attained, and the method of bodhicitta that accomplishes it. However, the method of giving rise to these in one's mindstream is superior in four ways:

1. Not being confused about the view of realization
2. Having many methods for accomplishing the result
3. Accomplishing enlightenment without hardship
4. Being for those of sharp faculties who accomplish the result quickly

Regarding the first, in general what is called "the view" is the natural state of phenomena. All Mahāyāna traditions agree that without realizing this natural state, which is free from elaboration, one cannot attain enlightenment. Therefore, while the Pāramitāyāna establishes realization through examples, logic and so forth, no matter how it is established, the understanding remains merely conceptual, fixating on one extreme of elaboration. In contrast, the Mantra tradition is superior because when wisdom arises in one's mindstream at the time of receiving the third empowerment and so forth, one directly realizes freedom from elaboration.

2. Regarding the many methods, there are two parts:
1. Many methods for accomplishing common results
2. Many methods for accomplishing supreme results

First, the common results range from invisibility and clairvoyance up to great enjoyments, great wisdom, and long life. Unlike the Pāramitāyāna which accomplishes these gradually through methods like generosity and so forth.

The perfection vehicle only accomplishes these gradually through methods like generosity, or if one desires them in this life, there are no other methods besides those common with worldly people. The mantra practitioner, however, accomplishes these effortlessly through countless methods of practice like Mañjuśrī and Vasudhārā, which also become aids for enlightenment. 2. Regarding the many methods for accomplishing supreme results, there are two parts:
1. Methods for realizing ultimate profound meaning
2. Methods for realizing conventional extensive meaning

Regarding the first, in the perfection vehicle there is nothing beyond mere intellectual understanding that "it is free from elaboration. " In contrast, even by just meditating on the generation stage, the mantra vehicle teaches the sixteen emptinesses with sixteen arms and so forth. Through the completion stage, it gives rise to non-conceptual samādhi through inconceivable methods like caṇḍālī. Regarding extensive realization, there are two parts:
1. Extensive realization such as arrangement of world systems
2. Extensive conduct and so forth

While the perfection vehicle only has general aspects of these, in the mantra vehicle one understands both completely just by meditating on a single maṇḍala. Through inconceivable methods like torma offerings and so forth, one can both realize and engage in both aspects. Therefore, it is superior due to having many methods. 3. Regarding accomplishing without hardship - while the perfection vehicle is a path of austerities and hardships requiring great effort, the mantra vehicle accomplishes enlightenment through pleasant conduct. Therefore it is superior. 4. Regarding being for those of sharp faculties - the followers of the perfection vehicle have dull faculties. Even at their fastest, it takes three countless eons to attain complete enlightenment.

The followers of mantra achieve it in this very life if they are of superior capacity, in the intermediate state if of medium capacity, and even those of lowest capacity achieve it within seven or sixteen lives. This has already been explained earlier in the sections on causal and resultant vehicles. Therefore, it is superior.

3. Regarding dispelling objections to this superiority, there are four parts:
1. Dispelling objections that they have the same meaning
2. Dispelling objections that the four distinctions are invalid
3. Dispelling objections that it contradicts the divisions of scripture or baskets
4. Dispelling objections that it is not time to practice secret mantra

Regarding the first, there are two parts:
1. Refuting arguments of non-equivalence
2. Refuting arguments that if equivalent, it would follow that it is interpretable meaning

Regarding the first: Some foolish people who have developed aversion to the profound meaning of the perfection vehicle and thus become hostile to the vajra vehicle argue: "The secret mantra vehicle and perfection vehicle are different in meaning, because while the perfection vehicle explains the divisions of the Buddha's form bodies and wisdoms, the divisions of grounds and perfections, emptiness and compassion and so forth, the vajra vehicle explains generation stage, completion stage and so forth - therefore they are not the same in meaning."

This is incorrect. The secret mantra vehicle also teaches those very meanings. As stated in the Noble Māyājāla:
"The system of the ten perfections,
The lord of the ten grounds,
The one dwelling on the ten grounds,
Possessing the nature of the ten pure wisdoms."

And in the Vajrapañjara Tantra...

And in the Vajrapañjara Tantra:
"Emptiness and compassion are not different.
Where mind is perfectly meditated upon,
That is the teaching of the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha as well."

Does this not encompass all vehicles? Similarly, I have not written all the scriptural sources from all tantras due to fear of too many words. Furthermore, the secret mantra teaches all of these completely in just meditating on a single generation stage maṇḍala, or even just one's own body alone. As it is said: "The incomparable square has four mindfulness gates" and so forth. Therefore, those who speak without understanding the meaning of the scriptures are worthy of contempt.

2. If one objects: "If the meaning is equivalent in this way, it would be sufficient to teach just that meaning alone. But since it teaches squares and so forth, by applying different words and different meanings to the secret mantra meaning, it becomes interpretable meaning."

This is incorrect. Let us ask this question: "What is the distinction between interpretable meaning and definitive meaning?"

If one responds: "Interpretable meaning refers to methods taught to lead those of lesser capacity to the authentic meaning, while definitive refers to what is authentic, taught for those of appropriate capacity. As stated in the Madhyamakāvatāra: 'Know that sūtras not teaching suchness are interpretable meaning, while those teaching emptiness are definitive meaning.'"

We would ask: "Does emptiness or authentic meaning refer to what is taught as the aspect of wisdom's negation? Or is definitive meaning referring to the non-duality of the two truths?"

If one asks this question, and one responds: "The definitive meaning is that which teaches the non-duality of the two truths as free from elaboration," we would ask: "Does this refer to what is taught explicitly or what is taught implicitly?"

If one says "explicitly," this cannot be taught by anyone, as even the Buddha himself could not express it directly, as stated by Ācārya Padmavajra: "That very suchness cannot be expressed even by the Victor. "

Even the Noble Vimalakīrti was unable to teach it and remained silent. If one argues: "Though it cannot be taught explicitly, sūtras containing terms like 'non-dual' and 'emptiness' are definitive meaning," then although such terms are also taught in secret mantra, merely knowing these terms does not constitute understanding suchness. Just as understanding arises gradually through relying on terms, realization of equality also arises through squares and so forth, therefore secret mantra is definitive meaning. Furthermore, since all Buddha's speech implicitly teaches this way, one cannot distinguish between interpretable and definitive meaning sūtras. If one thinks: "Definitive meaning refers to what teaches the aspect of wisdom's negation," such teachings are also abundant in secret mantra. Moreover, the perfection vehicle also has interpretable meaning since it teaches many aspects of aggregates, elements, sense bases, grounds and paths. Therefore, since both secret mantra and perfection sūtras each contain inconceivable aspects, they are all taught with complexity. For this reason, Noble Maitreya explained all sūtras through the divisions of the four intentions and four indirect expressions.

In the Noble Bodhisattva Piṭaka, eight different characteristics of interpretable and definitive meaning are explained:

1. Path engagement is interpretable meaning,
While result engagement is definitive meaning.
2. Conventional proof is interpretable meaning,
While ultimate proof is definitive meaning.
3. Engagement in karmic activities is interpretable,
While exhaustion of karma and afflictions is definitive.
4. Teaching afflictions is interpretable,
While teaching purification is definitive meaning.
5. Generating weariness with saṃsāra is interpretable,
While non-duality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is definitive.
6. Teaching various words and syllables is interpretable,
While profound difficult realization is definitive.
7. Many words pleasing beings is interpretable,
While few words easy to grasp is definitive.
8. Teaching self and so forth primarily is interpretable,
While teaching selflessness is definitive meaning.

Even according to these, secret mantra appears to be mostly definitive meaning. Furthermore, if one thinks: "By this reasoning that what is taught as the four foundations of mindfulness in the perfection vehicle is taught as the four gates and so forth in secret mantra, secret mantra would be interpretable meaning."

There is nowhere that such explanations are described as interpretable meaning. Even if it were interpretable meaning, for that very reason secret mantra is also definitive meaning. Regarding those aspects of enlightenment like the four foundations of mindfulness and so forth, there are three aspects:
1. The name
2. The practice 
3. The perfection

While the mere names are similar, they are first taught in the perfection vehicle to attract beginners. Teaching that "it is similar here" has the purpose of removing doubts about the path. Regarding the second, in terms of practice

2. Regarding practice, in the perfection vehicle one follows after names and gradually practices only general aspects, so it is long. In secret mantra, one follows after the meaning and immediately generates realization, teaching simultaneous practice, therefore this path is swift and supreme.

Regarding perfection of the result, since it is established through realization, that is taught as the suchness of maṇḍala and so forth. Although genuine wisdom exists at the sixth bhūmi in the perfection vehicle too, since there currently exists a gradual path of practice in accordance with that, they are equivalent. Therefore, since the final result is similar, they have the same meaning, and it is established that secret mantra primarily teaches definitive meaning.

2. Regarding the refutation of objections that the four distinctions are invalid, there are three parts:
1. Refuting the objection that the four distinctions are equivalent 
2. Refuting the objection that if they are not equivalent, the path would be mistaken
3. Refuting the objection that Kriyā tantras would not be secret mantra

1. The opponent argues: The Pāramitāyāna proponents say: "You Vajrayāna practitioners claim superiority through four distinctions, but these are actually equivalent to the Pāramitāyāna. Is being undeluded referring to the path or to persons? For the path, being deluded or undeluded is not tenable. As for persons, deluded ones are seen among mantra practitioners and undeluded ones are seen among Pāramitāyāna practitioners."

"2. Furthermore, regarding having many methods - this too is equivalent, since inconceivable divisions of the path are seen in the three characteristics, two truths, six perfections and so forth."

"3. Regarding the absence of hardship, this too is similar, since

in the Pāramitāyāna, it is explained that bodhisattva Dharmodgata and sixty-eight thousand women simultaneously enjoyed the five qualities of desire, and it is said that bodhisattva Sadāprarudita was together with five hundred maidens including the merchant's daughter. It is also taught that some bodhisattvas definitely need a wife and children. 

4. Regarding sharp faculties, this too is equivalent, since it is taught in the Great Secret Skillful Means that bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena can attain unsurpassed enlightenment in even seven days if they wish. For a beginner, there is nothing swifter than accomplishing enlightenment in three countless eons. Therefore, the four distinctions are equivalent."

The response: What you have explained about the paths being equivalent is partially true from certain perspectives. This actually accords with our position and establishes that the path of secret mantra is undisputed and has the same meaning. However, secret mantra is taught to be qualitatively superior to that.

Regarding your first question about whether being undeluded refers to the path or persons - deluded and undeluded refer to persons, and it is true that both exist. While it is also true that being deluded or undeluded are not paths themselves, there are paths that teach delusion and paths that teach non-delusion. Therefore, since mantra directly teaches suchness through examples, it is a path that makes persons undeluded.

Regarding the first point, since secret mantra directly teaches suchness through examples, it is a path that makes persons undeluded, while the perfection vehicle does not teach in this way and is therefore a path that makes persons deluded.

2. Regarding the claim that having many methods is equivalent - while it is true that many methods are explained in the perfection vehicle, secret mantra practitioners do not abandon those paths. Moreover, secret mantra is superior because it has inconceivable additional methods like the two stages of supreme and common accomplishment, mantra recitation, fire offerings and so forth, as explained previously.

3. Regarding the claim that absence of hardship is equivalent - those examples from the perfection vehicle refer to noble beings. Dharmodgata had attained dhāraṇī, and Sadāprarudita attained the path of accumulation upon hearing sounds from space, the path of preparation while practicing austerities, and the path of seeing when attaining non-coming and non-going. For such beings, desires do not bind them. The other cases were taught to accommodate beings with desire. In secret mantra, when one is held by the special methods, one becomes enlightened, thus it is superior. If you think the perfection vehicle also allows desire for beginners - that is taught as appropriate for those unable to abandon desire, but is not made into the path itself.

4. Regarding the claim that sharp faculties are equivalent - attaining acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena refers to the eighth bhūmi, but it takes two more countless eons after reaching that. This is extremely long. In secret mantra, through the power of a beginner's diligence, one can attain enlightenment in this life, at death, in the bardo, or within seven or sixteen lifetimes - thus the faculties are much sharper. The scriptural sources were given above in the section on results.

2. Refuting the objection that if they are not equivalent, the path would be mistaken. This has three parts:
1. Refuting the objection that seeing the truth requires being undeluded
2. Refuting the objection that having many methods without hardship makes the path mistaken
3. Refuting the objection that since sharp faculties and vast conduct are not taught, it equals the śrāvaka path

1. Some argue: "When you Vajrayāna practitioners generate wisdom during empowerment and meditation, and the guru generates certainty by saying 'This is suchness' - is that direct suchness itself or is it just a method indicating it? If you say it's a method, how is it different from logical reasoning like neither one nor many? If you say it's direct suchness, then it would be seeing the truth itself. "

In response to this, some confused people say: "We accept that, since there is no difference between seeing suchness and realizing this. " Well then, since your own body and appearances are not separate from mind, and when mind becomes free from concepts, what use are these characteristics and grasping since they are established as unobstructed? If you think "This yogin's body is temporarily bound, but when discarding it one will be liberated," then by that logic you would need to create a reason for dying. If you think "One will fall," then since even those who have attained acceptance do not go to lower realms, where could one who has seen the truth fall to? This is laughable! If you think "I have accomplished it, you just haven't seen it due to being impure," if you do not lie about yourself that is good - may it not become manifest pride! Even if you have seen just a little bit.

If you say "Then it would not be the path of seeing of the first bhūmi since it was already seen before. " If you say "I realized it before and now am experiencing it," in that case, since one could degenerate even after realizing suchness, the path of seeing would also degenerate, which is laughable. Furthermore, it would follow that at the time of realizing suchness, one should be able to display qualities like shaking a hundred billion world systems. Since there is no difference in realization, it is a natural fact that for those who have no difference in realization, there is no difference in qualities - like the buddhas. For those who claim it is actual wisdom, these and countless other faults arise. We accept it as just an example. If you ask "Then what is the difference from methods like reasoning about being neither one nor many?" There is a difference - those only bring understanding that there is no inherent nature, but do not make the mind free from concepts. It is like explaining the moon in terms of color and shape to someone who wants to see it. Here, the wisdom realized during empowerment and so forth is similar to the wisdom of the path of seeing in being free from elaboration, like using the moon's reflection in water as an example for someone who wants to see the moon. Therefore, even though one is not deluded, it does not become seeing the truth. Furthermore, if one does not meditate after realizing the example wisdom, since this is called the coming and going of wisdom, that wisdom will cease due to being obscured by great obscurations. Therefore, this yogin should not become extremely proud of their realization - they need to make great effort through diligence itself. If not, since it is not actual wisdom, its cessation is natural.

2. The objection that since there are many methods and no hardship, the path becomes misguided:

"This claim about many methods of accomplishing supreme siddhis through generation stage, channels, winds, drops and so forth being methods for realizing suchness is incorrect. The generation stage only results in the form kāya, and its suchness is the same as in the perfections. Since the non-Buddhists also have many methods involving drops, channels, winds and so forth, how could these be valid methods? Moreover, regarding the many methods for accomplishing ordinary siddhis - since these methods of killing and summoning beings harm sentient beings, how could there be enlightenment in this? Even a good rebirth would become distant.

Also, the claim that 'Since there is no hardship, enlightenment is accomplished through bliss' - if this were accomplished through indulging in desires, all ordinary beings would be accomplished. And if one could engage with objects through understanding suchness without being defiled and thereby achieve accomplishment - this would be equivalent to the Sāṃkhya view."

In response: Regarding the objection that one cannot accomplish through generation stage - even the secret mantras themselves state that mere attachment to the aspects of generation will not bring accomplishment. However, by meditating on completion stage while understanding that, one will gain union and become liberated through understanding its suchness. Therefore, there is a distinction from the perfections, because:
1. Even in a single deity's suchness, all objects of knowledge - both nature and extent - are established
2. All paths including the six perfections are included
3. The accumulations are completed continuously

Continuously completing the accumulations and directly accomplishing inconceivable purposes such as pacifying all adverse conditions in this life make it superior.

Regarding the objection that "since non-Buddhists also have practices involving winds and so forth, these are not valid paths," one should ask this question: Do you reject everything that exists among non-Buddhists or not? If you do not reject them, remain silent. If you reject them, since non-Buddhists also have generosity, moral discipline and so forth, these would have to be rejected.

To this, if one responds: "Because they are distinguished by being embraced by the three refuges, bodhicitta, and complete purity of the three spheres, they are different from non-Buddhist generosity and so forth," here too the same applies - we can similarly reverse the argument: through meditating on channels, winds, drops and so forth while being embraced by the three refuges, bodhicitta and complete purity of the three spheres, these are superior to non-Buddhist practices.

Regarding the objection that "the many methods like killing and summoning are not valid methods since they harm sentient beings," here one should understand there are two types of practitioners - superior and inferior. Regarding superior practitioners, even the perfection vehicle teaches this, as stated in the noble Ratnakūṭa:

"Whatever is the city's body becomes beneficial for the sugarcane field. Similarly, whatever is the fertilizer of afflictions becomes beneficial for the bodhisattva's field of enlightenment."

Likewise, there are many examples, such as the great compassionate ship captain who killed the black man with a spear and thereby purified eons of negative karma. Here too, killing and such done with hatred are prohibited. From scripture:

"Merely by harming beings..."

As stated in scripture:

"Merely by harming sentient beings,
One will not attain the siddhi of mudrā."

When embraced by skillful means, these actions are permitted. While this may be true for superior practitioners, if one objects that it is improper for inferior practitioners to engage in this path, then by that same logic, monastic discipline and teachings on emptiness would also be improper since they too can become causes of negativity when misused. If one thinks "Though improper, these still serve as a path for the inferior since they plant seeds of liberation," the same applies here as well.

Regarding the objection about "engaging carelessly in desires," one should ask: Then according to the perfection vehicle, would one be completely forbidden from eating food and making offerings to the Three Jewels? If one responds "There is no fault when done with the intention of maintaining one's body and making offerings to the Three Jewels," here too when embraced by skillful means it is permitted, while activities that distract the mind are always prohibited. 

If one objects "Then the paths would be equal," though it is true that there is no dispute regarding secret mantra since the general basis or root of the path is the same, it is superior because it clearly teaches many distinctions and easier practices. For example, just as emptiness and vastness are also taught in the śrāvaka scriptures and thereby established as Buddha's word of the Mahāyāna, similarly here too it is superior because of clearly teaching the distinctions.

3. Refuting the objection that it equals the śrāvaka path:

Here is the objection: "Although practitioners of secret mantra may have sharp faculties and achieve realization in this life or the intermediate state, since this is too quick, they will only attain an inferior result. Just as with rice that ripens too quickly like koṭa or śāli rice, here too, since it is said that śrāvakas are quickly liberated in three lifetimes, they achieve the inferior result of arhatship in three lives. But to accomplish the supreme result of buddhahood, one must engage in vast bodhisattva conduct with various difficult practices - without those, unexcelled enlightenment cannot be achieved. Therefore, even though secret mantra practitioners may have sharp faculties, since they have not engaged in vast conduct, they will achieve an inferior result like the śrāvakas."

In response, some masters explain: When it is said that secret mantra practitioners achieve realization in one life, this refers to attaining mahāmudrā siddhi at the first bhūmi, which is possible to achieve in this life due to having sharp faculties. Therefore, it is equivalent to the perfection path, since even in the perfections it is taught that upon attaining acceptance of the unborn dharmas, enlightenment can be achieved in seven days.

According to the learned master Śrī Ghoṣa: "Through the rituals of secret mantra practice, one attains the vidyādhara of mastery over life. In that very life of being a vidyādhara, buddhahood is explained to be accomplished." This indicates that when one attains immeasurable life, what contradiction could there be in also engaging in various difficult practices?

This interpretation also accords with the intent of the glorious Sampuṭa and Vajraḍāka tantras, which state that "accomplishment occurs in the life when one achieves essence extraction."

The Venerable One says: From the glorious Guhyasamāja:
"The ocean of bodhicitta,
Through that life of Vajrasattva is attained."

According to this, Master Candrakīrti explains: "The life of Vajrasattva means being free from illness, possessing longevity, and being free from obstacles. " 

In accordance with this, even with a contaminated body, if one strives with intense diligence in this very life, non-conceptual samādhi will arise. All excellent qualities of accomplishment such as miraculous powers will also manifest. When one fulfills the purposes of inconceivable beings in an instant, one also fulfills the vast conduct of bodhisattvas. As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:

"In some cases the mind of great enlightenment,
In some cases supreme victory over māras. "

And:
"Having given the body as offering,
Afterwards engage in perfect conduct. "

Therefore, accumulations are not completed through long duration, like the sufferings of saṃsāra. Even in a short time accumulations can be completed. It is explained that by praising the Tathāgata Nakṣatrarāja with one verse and performing seven circumambulations, the accumulations of nine eons are completed. Thus one should understand that in these words of the Venerable One, the views of both earlier masters are neither contradictory nor incompatible. 2. Refuting the objection that Kriyā and Caryā are not secret mantra:
Here is the objection: "If secret mantra is superior due to the four distinctions, since Kriyā and Caryā tantras lack the distinctions of being free from confusion and accomplishing enlightenment through bliss without hardship, they would not be secret mantra. Merely being known as secret mantra cannot serve as a valid reason, since even the perfections are sometimes labeled as secret mantra, which would lead to an absurd consequence. ".

The response to this is: While all agree that without the four Buddha seals one cannot be a Buddhist path, if that were applied [too strictly], since the Noble Śrāvakas do not accept the selflessness of all phenomena, and the Mahāsāṃghikas do not accept that all conditioned things are impermanent, how could they be Buddhists? If you say these [doctrines] were not entirely unexplained to them but were taught in a concealed way for those of lesser understanding, the same applies here. Even in Kriyā and Caryā tantras, there is blessing and thus freedom from confusion, and since they allow a degree of bliss through visualization and establishment, they are also free from hardship, though these are not extensively taught there. Therefore, although their distinctions are minor compared to Mahāyoga, since they have great distinctions compared to Pāramitāyāna, they qualify as secret mantra.

3. Refuting the contradiction with the classification of piṭakas:
Here is the objection: "The sūtras state that all Buddha's teachings are included within the three piṭakas. Since you have one additional piṭaka of secret mantra, that would make four piṭakas, contradicting the sūtras."

This is not correct. The three piṭakas refer to the Pāramitāyāna teachings. Since secret mantra is extraordinary and not widely known there, it constitutes a distinct, superior category called the Vidyādhara-piṭaka, just as Mahāyāna teachings were not known in the Śrāvaka tradition.

If you object that it must still be included within the three piṭakas and twelve branches of scripture, here is how they are included: When considering scripture generally, all vehicles including secret mantra are included within what is called the "extremely extensive piṭaka." This is also stated in the Mahāyoga tantra called Mañjuśrī-māyājāla:

"Thus, in the Mahāyoga tantra called Mañjuśrī-māyājāla, it is said to be the 'Extremely Extensive Great Bodhisattva Piṭaka.' Similarly, this is stated in the Vairocana-abhisaṃbodhi and Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa. 

Regarding the three piṭakas, Paṇḍita Abhayākaragupta explains:

All three are present:
1. The Vinaya teaches discipline
2. The Sūtra teaches mind
3. The Abhidharma teaches wisdom

Some explain that since it mainly teaches non-conceptual activity, it is Abhidharma.

The Venerable One states that it belongs to the Sūtra Piṭaka, because it primarily teaches the training in higher mind, or because it teaches all three trainings. As stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra regarding the characteristics of the three piṭakas:

1. The Vinaya is the dharma of discipline,
Due to falling, arising and lifting up,
Due to definite emergence and persons,
Due to rules and classifications.

2. The Abhidharma is due to causes,
Repetition, and realization through conquest.

3. The Sūtra is due to bases,
Characteristics, and expressing dharma meanings.

This characterization of the Sūtra matches what Ārya Asaṅga taught in the Abhidharma. Most secret mantra texts also refer to it as 'this sūtra.'

4. Some Śrāvakas who pride themselves in being Mahāyāna say: 'Although the vehicle of secret mantra is indeed an extraordinary sublime dharma, now is not the time to practice it because there are no teachers and students with the proper characteristics, and'"

Now is not the time to practice it because there are no teachers and students with the proper characteristics, and because while the benefits of maintaining [the commitments] are great, the faults of not maintaining them are severe, and because one cannot maintain the samaya commitments, and because in these degenerate times one is afflicted by many sufferings and cannot attain accomplishments. "

This is incorrect because although it may be difficult to find someone possessing all the qualifications, one can find teachers endowed with some of the characteristics of vajra masters explained in the tantras and śāstras, such as: "Steadfast, disciplined, and intelligent, patient, honest and free from deceit," and so forth. If this were not the case, since it would also be difficult to find any of the twenty-one sets of five preceptors for ordination who possess all the qualifications, ordination would also have to be rejected. And if one should not practice because the faults of not maintaining [the commitments] are severe, since this applies to all sublime Dharma, it would follow that one should not engage in any Dharma practice. If you think there are benefits just from hearing the sublime Dharma, the same applies here too. The claim that one cannot maintain the samaya commitments is also unreasonable. Just as it is easier for a fully ordained monk to maintain their vows if they can maintain the novice vows, if one maintains the three types of common bodhisattva discipline, one can also engage in secret mantra without impediment. The argument about degenerate times is also unreasonable. For precisely this reason, methods other than secret mantra cannot bring accomplishment. As stated in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa: "Furthermore, in future times at the end of the age, accomplishments cannot be attained. Understanding the Dharma in this way, all aspirations are fulfilled. " While accomplishment cannot be achieved through the Pāramitāyāna in these degenerate times, it can be achieved through secret mantra in these very degenerate times.

From the Herukaṃ Saṃbhava:

"When grasping glorious Heruka,
One will achieve in degenerate times."

Therefore, it is precisely in these present times that it is appropriate to engage in secret mantra. Although the venerable master has explained elsewhere this way in which the vehicle of secret mantra is superior to the perfections, I have written it here because it is particularly relevant to this context. These points should be understood through extensive analysis using scripture and reasoning. This concludes the fifth chapter from the General Presentation of the Tantra Classes, explaining how the manner of secret mantra is superior to the Vehicle of Perfections.

Now I will explain the specific determination of the vehicle of secret mantra. This has two parts:
1. The detailed classification of tantra classes
2. The presentation of how the vehicle of secret mantra arose

The first has three parts:
1. The division of all secret mantras into four tantra classes
2. The specific divisions of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra
3. Explaining the measure of the tantra classes

Regarding the first, there are four divisions:
1. Kriyā Tantra
2. Caryā Tantra  
3. Yoga Tantra
4. Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra

Regarding this system, the previous masters have said this: First is explaining how the number of tantra classes is definitively four, and how this does not contradict their being divided into three, five, six and so forth.

The first, although taught as five, here for ease of understanding we will present four parts:
1. How the number of tantra classes is definitely four
2. How both the number and order are definite  
3. The meaning of the names
4. Dispelling objections

The first has three parts:

1. The first has three parts:
1. 1. Division into four because there are four types of mistaken conduct due to misconceptions among the non-Buddhist tīrthikas who need to be guided
1. 2. Division into four tantra classes based on the four different approaches to deity generation corresponding to the four differing philosophical tenets within the Buddhist path of characteristics
1. 3. Division into four because when secret mantra is taught primarily for beings of the desire realm, there are four degrees of attachment (great, medium, etc. ), and to show there is a path to enlightenment even without abandoning these attachments

First, regarding the root of non-Buddhist traditions, it is the Vedic followers who accept the Vedas as authoritative, while others derive from them. Among the Vedic followers, there are four approaches:

1. Those dominated by desire who follow Maheśvara and propound desire as the path
2. Those dominated by hatred who follow Viṣṇu and propound violence as the path  
3. Those dominated by ignorance who follow Brahma and propound purity practices as the path
4. Those of equal conditions who, due to circumstantial influences, follow all three and propound all three as the path

These are not protected by the Three Refuges, not held by the view of selflessness, and not embraced by extraordinary skillful means. Therefore, they are causes for lower realms. Since guiding them requires practices that correspond to their tendencies, teaching these will lead them to enter the path. Having entered, they can be led to unsurpassed enlightenment through transformation by skillful means. Thus, the four tantra classes are taught. Moreover, regarding those dominated by desire who follow Maheśvara:.

Since the four types of desire-dominated followers of Maheśvara focus on the fruition of attaining great lordship in the form of the Saṃbhogakāya, after receiving the complete empowerments according to their tradition, they learn instructions such as the vase-breathing practice and the Garuḍa instructions. At special times they gather and perform rituals where men sit in rows on the right, women in rows on the left. In the center, they light nine butter lamps. As these burn, they insert the tips downward into water and engage in pleasures even with mothers and sisters. As stated:
"Gautamī is fire herself,
Her intimate place the hearth,
Her pubic hair the smoke,
Her inner passage the coals,
Her fluid the sparks of fire. In such a fire as this
The man burns divine seed
From which a person will arise. "

Similarly, they consume the five nectars, five meats and so forth, and engage in behaviors of dogs and pigs, with many adopting the observances of dogs, cows and so forth. However, since these practices are not embraced by the twofold view of selflessness and extraordinary skillful means like great compassion, they become causes for falling into lower realms and such. To guide those who practice thus, Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra was taught to accord with their conduct. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:
"Those of passionate wisdom 
Should always rely on the five sense pleasures. "

And:
"Having found a maiden with skin
The color of blue utpala,
One should make offerings with desire. "

And from Cakrasaṃvara:
"Among all magical illusions,
The woman's illusion is supreme. ".

In this way, it is taught in all Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras to engage in conduct dominated by desire. By teaching conduct that accords with their ways, they will enter [the path]. When they have entered, through teaching the view free from elaboration - such as "the sixteen years of wisdom are the sixteen emptinesses" - and through teaching the vast conduct of skillful means like great compassion, they will be led to enter unsurpassed enlightenment. Furthermore, there are some who follow Viṣṇu who are dominated by anger and teach violence as dharma. Focusing on the fruition to be attained in the form of Viṣṇu's Nirmāṇakāya, they perform sacrifices before their deity's support by killing animals, humans, and even their own bodies. As stated in the Yajurveda:

"When the intermediate time arrives,
Six or seven animals should be prepared. The horse is of the pure lineage. At minimum, three animals. "

And also:

"For royal caste, kill royal caste,
For brahmins, kill brahmins,
For the wicked, the merchant caste,
For the deluded class, kill the deluded class. "

Thus they assert that if one desires to attain such status, one should perform sacrificial rites of killing them. Since such teachings of violence as dharma lack skillful means, they are causes for lower realms. To guide those who practice thus, conducive practices are needed, so the Blessed One taught the Caryātantra. As stated in the Vijayakrodha Tantra:

"The Blessed Mañjughoṣa himself
Bears the wrathful name Yamāntaka. Upon seeing him, all other wrathful ones
Have all their weapons fall from their hands. ".

Through such verses, [the Buddha] displayed a terrifying form. And from that same [text]:

"Then here the one to be killed,  
Through perfect union however done,
Will be accomplished without doubt -
The supreme killing should be performed. "

And:

"Ah! This killing is excellent!
Killing is not killing at all. As long as one is freed from killing,
Through killing one attains enlightenment. "

And:

"Then arising from that,
With blazing sharp weapons,
The flesh and blood of what is killed
Should be offered as argham. "

And from the Vajrabhairava Tantra:
"Here, for the mantrin who wishes to kill. " and so forth, teachings of extremely fierce and wrathful dharma are given. By teaching in accordance with their ways, they will enter [the path]. When they have entered, skillful means are taught to them:

"This union is taught everywhere
To tame those who are harmful. It greatly harms the Three Jewels 
When practiced, but not otherwise. "

And:

"For one endowed with bodhicitta,
This will be accomplished, not otherwise. This grants accomplishment of all
The Tathāgata's samayas. "

And: "The killing is of afflictions and conceptual thoughts, not of sentient beings," and so forth - by teaching such skillful methods of intention, the Caryātantra was taught in order to establish them all in unsurpassed enlightenment. Furthermore, there are some confused followers of Brahmā who, due to ignorance, teach purification mantras as dharma. Focusing on the fruition to be attained in the form of Brahmā's Dharmakāya, they first perform what is called the "brahmin empowerment. ".

After the brahmin birth, when reaching twelve years of age, they perform the empowerment called "second birth." This is done with forty-eight ritual actions, making them an extremely pure lineage. As for their activities, they engage in pure conduct as taught in the four Vedas. Rising early, they walk about performing major and minor circumambulations. After performing three earth ablutions and three water ablutions, they hold the brahmin thread, kuśa grass and ritual pills, and make fire offerings. "Bringing the fire closer first benefits the sacrifice. Supreme among deities, this is called making precious offerings at the fire offering site," and so forth they recite while making offerings. They also perform fasting, as stated:

"For one night or three nights,
For seven days or just one day - 
Whoever maintains the fast
Will go to the higher realms."

They also purify negativities through ablutions at bathing places, as stated:
"Just as clothes stained with mud
Become clean and stainless,
So beings marked by offerings
Are cleansed by bathing at the steps."

Thus they believe in liberation through pure conduct. Since such beliefs in purity as dharma lack skillful means and generate hatred toward others due to attachment to their own caste and dharma, they are causes for lower realms. To guide those who practice thus, the Blessed One taught practices in accord with their ways in the Kriyātantra. As stated in the Supratiṣṭha:

"Meat, alcohol, onions, garlic cloves,
Oil, sesame, radishes, beer,
Spirit flesh, divine food offerings,
And offerings made with beef should not be eaten.
For mantrins, I taught the three white foods..."

"For mantrins, I taught the three white foods,
Root vegetables, stems, fruits, and vegetables,
Oil, grain, yogurt, and milk,
And soups as food and drink. "

And:

"Having eaten at the proper time and bathed at the proper time,
With rosary, butter lamp, incense, praise and scent,
Having offered torma without meat and alcohol,
Sit on kuśa grass and begin recitation. "

Through teaching such things as pure food and conduct, ablutions, and fire offerings, they become pleased and thereby enter [the path]. Having entered, as stated in the Subāhuparipṛcchā:

"The Tathāgata did not teach fasting
For the sake of purifying the body of an only son. For the sake of accomplishing meditative concentration and bliss,
The Tathāgata subsequently taught fasting. "

And through verses like: "The purification of negativities through water ablutions is due to the power of the aspiration prayers of the nāga king Anavatapta, the bodhisattva," they are gradually connected with the inner skillful means and established in unsurpassed enlightenment. Therefore the Kriyātantra was taught. Furthermore, there are some who follow all three [types] equally due to the force of similar conditions. Having focused on all three attainments, they teach all three as dharma. When meeting teachers who teach desire as dharma, they engage in practices of desire. When meeting those who teach anger as dharma, they engage in harmful practices. When meeting those who teach ignorance as dharma, they engage in practices of purity. They engage in whatever practices are not prohibited. However, since these also lack skillful means, they are causes for lower realms.

After the previous teachings, since those who are to be guided need corresponding practices, the Bhagavān taught the Yoga Tantras. In the first section of the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra, the Vajradhātu section, in order to guide those dominated by desire, all deities are depicted with passionate expressions. In the second section, the Trailokyavijaya section, in order to guide those dominated by anger to abandon anger through wrath, all deities have wrathful expressions. In the third section, the Jagadvinaya section, in order to guide those dominated by ignorance, all deities have peaceful expressions. In the fourth section, the Sarvārthasiddhi section, in order to guide those of uncertain disposition, all deities are taught having various colors and expressions. Furthermore, in that tantra, in the section called "Recitation of All Concepts," various practices like cleanliness and so forth are taught to be recited according to one's inclination.

Therefore, through teaching these uncertain methods, they enter [the path]. Once they have entered, by being granted the skillful means of complete liberation of all tathāgatas, the Yoga Tantra was taught in order to lead them to unsurpassed enlightenment. Thus, following the Tattvasaṃgraha, the early masters like Subāhupāla and Ānandagarbha and others asserted that there are four tantra classes in order to guide those with the four wrong practices among the tīrthikas who engage in knowledge.

2. There are four incompatible philosophical tenets among Buddhists, so in accordance with these, through four different methods of deity generation, the four classes of tantras are established:

2. 1 The lower capacity Śrāvakas known as Mahāsāṃghikas and the middling capacity Śrāvakas known as Pārśva-Vaibhāṣikas follow the Buddha's words in the sūtras: "Monks, there is both a burden and a bearer of the burden. " They assert the existence of a personal self [pudgala], which is:
- Inexpressible as permanent, since it discards these aggregates and takes up other aggregates
- Inexpressible as impermanent, since karma performed here is experienced by the self elsewhere
- Inexpressible as identical to the aggregates, since the aggregates are impermanent
- Inexpressible as different, since it is the continuum of the aggregates
Therefore, they assert an inexpressible self [pudgala]. Accordingly, the generation method of Kriyātantra is taught: Having spread out a painted cloth in front, arranged offerings and performed ablutions and so forth, one performs the ritual of inviting the wisdom being [jñānasattva] to the front. Having arranged the mantra garland at its heart, one recites - this is called the method of receiving accomplishments like a servant from a master. In accordance with their philosophical view, while they accept what is called the wisdom being, it is neither the painted image nor oneself, as oneself is ordinary. Thus it is taught in the Jñānavajrasamuccaya Tantra: "Without pride in oneself as the deity and without the bliss of the wisdom being - this characterizes those who have entered Kriyātantra. "

Furthermore, regarding the Śrāvaka philosophical tenets, the supreme ones - the Vaibhāṣikas and Sautrāntikas - based on the Buddha's teaching that "There is karma, there is ripening, but an agent is not observed," do not accept such a personal self. They accept that objects to be grasped are ultimately real particles, and the grasping consciousness is ultimately real moments.

Accordingly, the generation method of Caryātantra is taught: Having generated oneself as the commitment being [samayasattva], one invites the wisdom being [jñānasattva] to the front. Having arranged the mantra at its heart, one recites - this is called the method of receiving accomplishments like from a friend. In accordance with their philosophical view of accepting both grasped and grasper, this is the generation method with two deities. Furthermore, the noble Pratyekabuddhas assert that since objects, when divided into six parts of particles, are without inherent nature, there is no object to be grasped, while the grasping consciousness exists only momentarily because moments have no parts. Thus, as stated in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra: "To abandon the conception of the grasped, but not abandon the grasper, is the path like a rhinoceros through dependence. "

The corresponding generation method is that of Yoga Tantra: Having generated oneself as the commitment being, one inserts the wisdom being into it. This accords with accepting both grasped and grasper conventionally. Furthermore, both Mahāyāna Cittamātrins assert "Without the grasped, there is no grasper there" and Mādhyamikas accept that conventionally there are both grasped and grasper. Corresponding to this is the generation method of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra:

First one generates oneself as the commitment being, then inserts the wisdom being, which accords with accepting both grasped and grasper conventionally. Just as ultimately neither is accepted, the wisdom being is not requested to depart, so this is called the generation method where the wisdom being does not depart. Thus, the establishment of the four tantra classes through four different generation methods follows the Jñānavajrasamuccaya and is accepted by noble Nāgārjuna and others, as stated by the earlier masters.

3. Since the secret mantra was taught for the sake of beings in the desire realm, there are four levels - great and medium - of attachment. To show that there is a path to enlightenment without abandoning these, the definitive four classes of tantra are:

The gods of the desire realm called Paranirmitavaśavartin are satisfied by mere looking and granted bliss to that extent - this is Kriyātantra. As stated in the Kriyātantra Vajroṣṇīṣa: "All the deities of the maṇḍala dwell permanently on white cloth, with males gazing at females and females gazing at males."

Furthermore, the gods of the desire realm called Nirmāṇarati are satisfied by looking plus mere smiling, and are granted bliss to that extent - this is Caryātantra. As stated in the Vairocanābhisambodhi: "The great king Vairocana should be depicted with a slightly smiling face."

Furthermore, the gods of the desire realm called Tuṣita and Yāma are satisfied by looking and smiling plus mere hand-holding and embracing, and are granted bliss to that extent - this is Yoga Tantra. As stated in the Śrīparamādya: "All the deities of the maṇḍala should be placed with arms slightly bent." And as stated in the Vajraśekhara: "Whatever consort is desired, the yogin should give a kiss. With hand mudrā expanded, the arms should be tightly embraced."

Furthermore, the gods of the Thirty-Three, the Four Great Kings, humans and others are satisfied by the previous plus sexual union, and are granted bliss to that extent - this is Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra. As stated in the Hevajra: "Through union of vulva and vajra..."

"Through union of vulva and vajra, one comes to know that bliss. "

Thus, regarding the certainty of these levels of desire realm attachment, the Treasury states:
"Sexual union is through embracing in pairs,
Hand-holding, laughing, and looking. "

The tantras that follow this are definitively four in number. As stated in the Hevajra:
"Through laughing and looking,
Through embracing and likewise through pairs,
The tantras are of four types. "

Following this, masters like Bhavabhadra and their followers assert this. This system is evidently among the five tantra systems and is an excellent approach. 2. Regarding the second general topic, determining the enumeration and order:
The Vajrapañjara states:
"Kriyātantra for inferior ones,
Above that is non-Kriyā Yoga,
Supreme Yoga for supreme beings,
Above that is Unsurpassed Yoga. "

Thus, considering the four levels - great and medium - of purified individuals, the four classes of tantra are established:

1. For those of lowest capacity with inferior intellect who delight in external activities like ablutions, Kriyātantra was taught showing external activities. 2. For those superior to them who engage in both external physical and verbal activities and internal meditation, Caryātantra was taught. 3. For those even more superior who engage primarily in meditation alone, Yoga Tantra was taught. 4. For those who have become most supreme and engage in the unsurpassed special type of meditation, Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra was taught. Thus, in order to guide these four types of individuals, there are definitely four different approaches for entering [the path].

Following the Vajrapañjara Tantra, this system was propounded by masters like Vīravapa and Ḍombiheruka who had attained accomplishments. Since this system is indeed present in the tantras, it is an excellent approach. 3. Regarding the third general topic, the meaning of the names:

Why is it called Kriyātantra? Because it primarily teaches external physical and verbal activities. As stated in the Commentary on the Dhyānottara: "This tantra is called Kriyātantra because it primarily teaches external physical and verbal activities. "

Why is it called Caryātantra? Because it equally engages in both physical and verbal activities and meditation. As stated in the Summary of the Meaning of Vairocana's Enlightenment: "This is called Caryātantra because it engages in both worldly conduct that contradicts pure observances and their opposites. "

Why is it called Yoga Tantra? Because it primarily teaches meditation. As stated in the Summary of Illuminating Suchness: "This is called Yoga Tantra because it primarily teaches meditation. "

Why is it called Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra? Because it teaches the special type of meditation that is unsurpassed. As stated in the Saṃpuṭa:
"Please explain the unsurpassed 
Secret wisdom essence, O Blessed One. "

And likewise in the Guhyasamāja:
"Supreme body, speech and mind,
The speech of all the Tathāgatas,
The unsurpassed bodhicitta—
Please explain this essence, O Blessed One. "

4. Regarding the fourth general topic, refuting objections to the definitive enumeration of the four tantra classes, there are two parts:
1. Showing there is no contradiction with assertions of three, five or six classes
2. Establishing the reasoning for the definitive enumeration as four.

1. Regarding showing there is no contradiction with assertions of three, five or six classes:

If there were only four tantra classes, this would contradict some masters who assert three classes, some who assert five, and some who assert six. Therefore, this would invalidate the definitive enumeration as four classes.

Regarding those who assert three tantra classes, Buddhaguhya states:
"Through divisions of Yoga Practice and Action,
The tantra classes are asserted as three."

This is explained as including Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra within Yoga Tantra by considering only that meditation is primary. Many masters have accepted this system.

Regarding the system that asserts five tantra classes, following what is taught in the Jñānavajrasamuccaya Tantra: "Seated in the bhaga in the midst of the consort's retinue to teach bodhicitta arising from desire, teaching practices contrary to worldly ways and sixfold explanation is found in Yoga Tantra. Arranged in the maṇḍala of awareness and goddesses, teaching the ten realities and accomplishing activities from that is found in Both Tantra. Teaching extensive ritual activities and characteristics of mudrā visualization is found in Caryā Tantra. Focused on the worldly with extreme purity, without bliss of the wisdom being (jñānasattva), without divine pride in oneself, and engaging in practices of the wondrous sphere through conceptual causes of faults is found in Kriyā Tantra. Accomplishing through practice of mantras, fire offerings, powders, swift-footedness and the eight mundane attainments is found in Kalpa Tantra." Following this, masters like Nāgārjuna asserted five tantra classes.

Moreover, Kalpa Tantra is also included within Kriyātantra since it primarily teaches external activities. The different names are merely terminological variations. Another system asserting five classes follows the Hevajra [Tantra]:
"Through laughter and view,
Through embrace and likewise through twofold,
The four classes of tantra
Have unexpressed intended meanings. "

Based on this implication of a fifth class, masters like Vīravapa asserted five classes: Kriyā, Caryā, Yoga, Higher Yoga, and Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra. However, this division emerged from the Greater Hevajra. Since both Higher Yoga and Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra are included within the unsurpassed secret wisdom, there are [actually] four tantra classes. Regarding those who assert six tantra classes, following what is taught in the root Śrī Cakrasaṃvara Tantra:

"However many sūtras, kriyā, caryā,
Yoga and secret ultimate divisions there are,
Beings have various dispositions
And delight in these accordingly. "

Following this, masters like Kamala asserted six tantra classes: 1. Sūtra, 2. Kalpa Tantra, 3. Kriyā, 4. Caryā, 5. Yoga, 6. Secret Ultimate - meaning the Guhyasamāja and others, with Cakrasaṃvara Tantra being the sixth. However, this sixfold division merely shows different enumerations of the teachings. In essence, it does not go beyond the previous four classes. Although Kalpa Tantra is separated out based on considering only that it teaches minor attainments, since it maintains the inferior approach of teaching external activities, it belongs to Kriyātantra.

Also, though "Secret Ultimate" is mentioned separately as a class of Tantras of the Yoginīs, according to other systems, the Nirmāṇakāya is not presently dwelling in the human realm, while according to the Cakrasaṃvara system, they presently dwell in the twenty-four sacred places. Thus, others consider accomplishments to be near. Moreover, while other tantric expressions were later clarified by other Nirmāṇakāyas and bodhisattvas making them easy to understand, the Cakrasaṃvara Tantra, being taught exclusively by the primordial Buddha without modification, contains many obscure symbols and deteriorated terminology, making it inexplicable without guru's instructions. Even someone like Master Śāntipa, renowned as a second omniscient one, was unable to compose a commentary. Therefore, considering only the difficulty in understanding the expressions, it was classified separately. However, there is nothing separate from the unsurpassed secret wisdom in terms of meaning. 2. Regarding the reasoning for the definitive enumeration as four, there are three parts:
1. Beings
2. Empowerments 
3. Paths

2. 1. First, since the Blessed One taught the tantras for the benefit of beings, and since beings are definitively enumerated as four types, the tantra classes are definitively enumerated as four. This is like how the six collections of consciousness arise in relation to the six objects of perception. 2. 2. Second, since the impurities to be purified are definitively enumerated as four, and since the purifying empowerments are also definitively enumerated as four, the tantras teaching these are definitively enumerated as four. This is like how specific substances are required to clean precious metal ore. 2. 3. Third, since the four types of beings must obtain the four ways of ripening and must practice the four types of paths, the tantras teaching these are definitively enumerated as four, just like the previous example.

Therefore, since beings, empowerments and paths are definitively enumerated as four, the tantra classes are definitively enumerated as four. This is a natural reasoning.

2. The division of such Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra into three:
1. Father Tantra of great yoga methods
2. Mother Tantra of wisdom 
3. Non-dual Tantra of method and wisdom

There are three distinctions:
1. Distinction of expressing words
2. Distinction of expressed meaning
3. Distinction of requesters or disciples to be trained

2.1. Regarding the first, following what Master Kṛṣṇācārya stated in the Illuminating the Secret Reality:
"What was spoken thus and so forth
In the Yoga Tantras,
In the Mother Tantras is expressed as
'The supreme secret delight'
Always dwelling as the nature of all."

Following this, tantras beginning with "Thus have I heard" and forty letters like Guhyasamāja are Yoga Tantras. Those beginning with "Supreme secret delight" and such, like Cakrasaṃvara, are Mother Tantras. The Hevajra Tantra begins with "Thus have I heard" in its root tantra, while in the Vajrapañjara it begins with "In supreme secret delight." Since both appear in the Saṃpuṭa, it is a Non-dual Tantra of method and wisdom.

2.2. Regarding the second distinction of expressed meaning, there are three:
1. Distinction of generation stage
2. Distinction of completion stage  
3. Distinction of post-practice purification

2.2.1. Following what is taught in the Vajrapañjara:
"This assembly of supreme ḍākinīs
Of all the Buddhas—
Since the five ḍākinīs are well accomplished,
It is called a Ḍākinī Tantra."

Following what was stated, there are those with male deities predominating called method tantras, and those with female deities predominating called wisdom tantras. By the phrase "Buddha's ḍākinī", those showing the Tathāgata in ḍākinī form are Ḍākinī Tantras, while those showing Buddha in deity form like Guhyasamāja are Method Tantras. The Hevajra and similar tantras that both predominantly feature male deities and are ḍākinī tantras are Non-dual Tantras.

Regarding the distinction of completion stage, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:
"The method of the perfection of wisdom
Is declared to be Yoginī.
Because it teaches reality itself,
It is explained as Yoga Tantra."

Following this, those teaching the completion stage of the maṇḍala wheel as the method of wisdom are Wisdom Tantras. Those teaching stages like subtle drops and so forth are Method Tantras. Those teaching both are Non-dual Tantras.

3. Regarding the distinction of purification: Yoga Tantras teach the purification of the coarse aggregates, elements and sense bases. As stated in the Guhyasamāja:
"In brief, the five aggregates
Are all the Tathāgatas."

While in Cakrasaṃvara it states:
"In these places the ḍākinīs
Perfectly abide in the beautiful form of channels."

The Hevajra teaches both, stating:
"The form aggregate is Vajrā"
And:
"The channels are the yoginīs,
Each declared to be the various forms."

3. Regarding the distinction of requesters or disciples to be trained, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:
"To train male practitioners,
Yoga Tantra is taught.
To gather female practitioners,"

"And to gather female practitioners,
The Yoginī Tantra is explained. "

Following this, in Guhyasamāja and similar texts, there are statements like "Then the bodhisattvas Maitreya and others requested. " which makes them Method Tantras. In Vajraḍāka and similar texts, there are statements like "Then the goddess paid homage to the Bhagavān and requested thus. " which makes them Mother Tantras. The Hevajra represents the non-dual of method and wisdom, as stated:

"The Yoginī Tantra Hevajra
Was first taught by the Victors. Later the Yoginī Tantra
Was taught to be grasped by women. "

If one objects that Hevajra is a Yoginī Tantra since it is stated "The Yoginī Tantra Hevajra" and even in the Vajrapañjara's enumeration of fourteen Mother Tantras, Hevajra is listed and described as a Ḍākinī Tantra - this is true, it is indeed a Ḍākinī Tantra. However, this does not contradict it being a Non-dual Tantra, since Non-dual Tantras must include wisdom tantras, and moreover it is stated:

"Listen as I explain
The tantra that embodies method and wisdom. "

This can also be understood through the previously explained citations like "The Yoginī Tantra Hevajra" and so forth. 3. Establishing the Non-dual Method and Wisdom Tantra has two parts:
   3. 1 The general system of tantra
   3. 2 Specifically establishing the Hevajra Tantra

3. 1 The general system has four parts:
   3. 1. 1 Root and explanatory tantras
   3. 1. 2 How they are arranged
   3. 1. 3 Brief and extensive
   3. 1. 4 Counting the texts

First has two parts:
1. Characteristics
2. Classifications.

1. Characteristics: A root tantra is that which appeared first and serves as the basis of explanation, while an explanatory tantra is that which appeared later and serves as the means of explanation. 2. Classifications:
2. 1 Root tantras are divided into two:
   a. Extensive
   b. Brief

2. 2 Explanatory tantras are divided into two:
   a. Common
   b. Uncommon

Regarding extensive root tantras, they were mainly taught for the sake of disciples at the time when the Dharma wheel was turned. Brief tantras were mainly taught for the sake of future disciples with short lives and lesser intellects who would be unable to retain the extensive tantras. Explanatory tantras have two types:
1. Common
2. Uncommon

Common ones clarify many classes of tantra, while uncommon ones specifically clarify their own respective tantra class. In general, there are six ways in which a text functions as an explanatory tantra:
1. Clarifying what is unclear
2. Supplementing what is incomplete
3. Different methods
4. Condensing the meaning
5. Generating certainty in similar aspects
6. Detailed explanation of words and meanings

Regarding how a text functions as an explanatory tantra by clarifying what is unclear: For example, in the Hevajra it states:
"That which fully differentiates empowerment
Is bestowed through one's own maṇḍala ritual. "
The unclear meaning of empowerment here is clearly explained in the Vajrapañjara. Similarly, where there is only a brief mention like "This blessing of Vajrakrodha becomes five or six families," the Vajrapañjara clearly explains the individual families and methods of condensation. Regarding supplementing what is incomplete: For example, the vajra names that are incomplete in the Second Chapter are supplemented in the Vajrapañjara.

Regarding similar aspects, it is like how both the Two Segments (Hevajra) and the Vajrapañjara similarly explain the fifteen goddess consorts of Nairātmyā. Regarding different methods, it is like showing slight variations in the hand implements of Gaurī and others, or in mantras. Regarding condensing the meaning, explanatory tantras can condense extensive teachings, like how the extensive practices taught in the Two Segments are taught in condensed form in the Vajrapañjara. Similarly, there are texts like the Vajragarbhābhisaṃbodhi that condense both the words and meaning of extensive tantras. Regarding detailed explanation of words and meanings: For example, in the Two Segments, the subject of proximate cause is briefly taught in the eighth chapter, while in the fifteenth chapter of the Vajrapañjara, time and other aspects are clearly explained. Similarly, where the root tantra only mentions names like Abhedyā and other channels, or merely lists names in verses like "The sites and near-sites. " without further explanation, the Saṃpuṭa clearly explains where they are located with statements like "Abhedyā abides at the crown" and explains the sites with statements like "The site is the ground of supreme joy. "

Any text that possesses these qualities is called an explanatory tantra. If one objects: "If clarifying what is unclear and giving detailed explanations of words and meanings qualify as explanatory tantras, then how can similar aspects, different methods, condensing the meaning, and supplementing what is incomplete be explanatory tantras? Since all tantras have inconsistencies with each other and what exists in one is absent in another, wouldn't they all become explanatory tantras for each other?" This is not correct - those similar aspects generate special certainty in the meaning of the tantra, thus making them explanatory tantras.

Regarding "different methods," this refers to the deities themselves being ritual procedures, with variations in color, implements, and other aspects being taught differently in brief and extensive explanations - these are explanatory tantras due to their different methods. Similarly, when ritual components themselves are incomplete and need supplementation, these are called explanatory tantras that supplement what is incomplete. Additionally, when extensive teachings from the root tantra are made easily understandable through condensation, these become explanatory tantras. 

2. Regarding the arrangement, there are three types:
   2.1. Arranged according to the sequence of births in beings' continua
   2.2. Arranged according to the sequence of entry
   2.3. Arranged according to the sequence refuting arbitrary entry

3. Brief and extensive has two types:
   3.1. Brief and extensive in terms of words
   3.2. Brief and extensive in terms of meaning

4. Regarding counting texts, for verses: The second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth roots each count as one śloka. For prose passages, every nine syllable gaps count as one part of "Indrīya Vajra," with four of these making one śloka - this is how they are counted.

The second specific topic, establishing the Hevajra Tantra, has four parts:
1. Root and explanatory tantras
2. Arrangement
3. Brief and extensive
4. Text length

The first has two parts:
1.1. Extensive and brief root tantras
1.2. Common and uncommon explanatory tantras

Regarding the first, the extensive root tantra contains thirty-two analyses, thirty thousand chapters, and five hundred thousand verses. As stated in the Vajrapañjara:

"The great ocean of five hundred thousand,
Amazing, the extensive teaching of tantra."

And:
"Through the enumeration of thirty thousand,"

And as stated:

"Through enumeration of thirty thousand,
The great ocean of five hundred thousand."

And from the Vajrapañjara:
"The Vajra Essence Perfect Enlightenment,
Is indeed the first king of analyses,
[...continuing] up to...
Is explained in the thirtieth analysis."

The Two-Segment Analysis also states it was extracted from the thirty-two analyses.

Furthermore, the condensed root tantra is this text of Twenty-Three Chapters with 750 verses in Two Segments.

Regarding whether this condensed root tantra was extracted from the extensive tantra or is a separate tantra - some like the glorious Phamthingpa claim it is a separate tantra, saying:

"The extensive tantra has thirty-two analyses, below that is the twelve-analysis tantra, below that is the nine-analysis tantra, and the smallest is this Two-Segment Analysis."

However, this is incorrect as it contradicts the statement in this very text that says it was "extracted from the great king of tantras, the magical analysis of thirty-two segments."

Some others like Nāropa claim this tantra was extracted from the first two analyses of the extensive tantra, citing the Vajrapañjara:

"The Vajra Essence Perfect Enlightenment
Is indeed the first king of analyses,
The second is the magical analysis."

They argue this based on the inconsistency with the names "King of Analysis of the Manifest Enlightenment of Vajra Essence" and "Magical Analysis" found in this text, and because there is a prologue at the beginning of the tantra.

This too is incorrect. As stated in the eleventh chapter:

"What was extensively taught above
In the twelve analyses is condensed in brief."

Some claim this cannot serve as explanation of the verses:
"Like before, regarding the ritual sequence of the higher tantra -
The ritual water and foot-washing follow those above. "

This reasoning is not valid, as inconsistency also cannot serve as a reason. Though both chapter 4 and chapter 10 of the first analysis of this very text are labeled as "empowerment chapters," they are not the same, which proves the point. Therefore, this is not from the first two analyses but rather from the final two. Moreover, it is both a condensed tantra that summarizes the meaning of the higher ones and an extracted tantra. How do we know this is the case? This very text states it was "extracted from the thirty-two analyses. " And the explanatory tantra Vajrapañjara, after naming the "thirtieth analysis," states:

"The pure essence completely condensed
Of the ḍākas and ḍākinīs,
Spoken by the Vajra Sky-goer - 
This is the tantra's determination. "

This shows that this text consists of the thirty-first and thirty-second analyses. The Vajrapañjara demonstrates both the fault in claiming this Two-Segment Analysis is the first analysis of the extensive tantra, and the evidence that it is the latter. From its beginning with "The sky along with material elements becoming clear. " it summarizes the complete meaning of the extensive tantra. Then in its fifteenth chapter it states:

"Thus have I heard: At one time,
I, before the Blessed One,
Abiding in the Queen's dharma,
Gazing, summoning, great signs,
The power to accomplish aims, rain and so forth. "

This shows it condenses the second analysis. Furthermore, the Vajrapañjara's statement about the purpose of condensing from the extensive tantra also proves this Two-Segment Analysis is the latter one.

Here is someone claiming this is the condensed tantra Vajrapañjara itself. This is incorrect because the Vajrapañjara states:

"The Hevajra Yoga Tantra
Was first taught by the Victors. The latter Yoginī Tantra
Was taught for the sake of female disciples. "

This indicates the condensed tantra has two analyses, with the first taught for male disciples and the latter for female disciples. These characteristics are not found in the Vajrapañjara but are found in the Two-Segment Analysis. Therefore, this Two-Segment Analysis came after and condenses the meaning of the extensive tantra. Others claim there exists a different condensed tantra that is neither the Vajrapañjara nor the Two-Segment Analysis. Since this claim lacks any logical basis, it is mere assertion. Therefore, this itself is the condensed tantra. The issues of name similarity and existence of a prologue have already been addressed above. 2. The uncommon explanatory tantra of Hevajra is the Vajrapañjara, as it clearly explains only the Five Hundred Thousand and the Two-Segment Analysis. The common explanatory tantra is the Sampuṭa, as it clearly explains many tantric systems. Regarding this, King Indrabhūti explained it as the explanatory tantra of the thirty-six hundred thousand tantric systems. Currently there are actually sixteen or seventeen tantras that are directly beneficial. The great master Mahāmati and others consider this Vajrapañjara to be a condensed tantra. Some masters consider it a tantra that correlates with the Two-Segment Analysis. These views are not contradictory.

2. The Two-Segment Analysis is a condensation of the profound meaning of manifest enlightenment from the extensive tantra. Since the Vajrapañjara condenses all aspects of words and meaning from the Five Hundred Thousand, there is no contradiction in it being a condensation from that perspective. However, it is not a condensed manifest enlightenment.

Furthermore, these two mutually correlate and are explanatory tantras, since they clarify each other.

3. Regarding their arrangement:
1. The root tantra is arranged according to the sequence of introducing disciples
2. The Sampuṭa is arranged according to the sequence of stages of development for disciples
3. The Vajrapañjara is arranged in a mixed order without sequence

4. Regarding length and brevity:
1. The root tantra exists in three parts
2. The Vajrapañjara exists in two parts  
3. The Sampuṭa exists in five parts

5. Regarding textual length:
1. The root tantra has 750 ślokas
2. The Vajrapañjara has 1,025 ślokas
3. The Sampuṭa has 2,803 ślokas

6. Third general topic - explaining the measure of the tantra classes:
If one wonders how many tantras exist in each of these four tantra classes, the Glorious Jñānavajrasamuccaya states:
1. Kriyā tantras number four thousand
2. Caryā tantras also number four thousand  
3. Yoga tantras number eight thousand
4. Non-dual tantras number six thousand
5. Yogic tantras number twelve thousand

Thus there are thirty-four thousand in total. When elaborated, they are innumerable. This explains the measure of the five tantras. The measure of Yoginī tantras is not mentioned there.

The glorious Cakrasaṃvara Saṃbhava Tantra also states:
"The measure of Yoga tantras
Is determined as six million.
Likewise the number of Yoginī tantras

Is determined as six million.
Likewise the number of Yoginī tantras
Numbers sixteen million.
Similarly, in the manner of Pāramitās,
Five hundred million and one trillion.
For Mahāyāna sūtras other than those,
Eight trillion were taught."

These numbers should not be understood as verse counts, but rather as counts of distinct names of tantras or sūtras. How so? When it says there are four thousand Kriyā tantras, the Ārya-amoghapāśa-sūtra alone contains eight thousand verses. Similarly, the Tattvasaṃgraha has one hundred thousand verses, the Hevajra has seven hundred thousand, the Five Hundred Thousand, and texts like the Saṃpuṭa of eighteen thousand verses each contain many verses. Therefore, the number of tantric texts is immeasurable.

From the Vajrapañjara Tantra:
"The Ḍākinī Bliss, Ocean Bliss, and Sky,
Great Joy Consuming, Secret Mental Bliss,
Great Bliss Display and Golden Rain,
The eight beneficial Vajraḍāka tantras,
All Buddhas' Hevajra maṇḍala,
Secret Treasury and Vajrāmṛta Source,
And Cakrasaṃvara's Source of Tents - 
These are known as the six classes of Yoginī tantras."

One should understand that these fourteen tantras and others comprise the six classes of Yoginī tantras, but not that only these fourteen are Yoginī tantras.

For example, from the glorious Cakrasaṃvara root tantra:
"What was taught in the Tattvasaṃgraha,
What was taught in the Secret Tantra,
What was taught in the glorious Paramādya,
What was taught in the Vajrabhairava - 
These are accomplished through recitation and fire offerings."

"These are not accomplished through meditation alone."

This means one should not look only to those tantras, but should understand that all practices emphasizing recitation and fire offerings, etc., are included.

Thus when divided into three, four, or five tantra classes, when these six are individually categorized, there exists an immeasurable number of tantras.

Although it is taught there are 84,000 aggregates of Dharma, this was condensed according to the capacity of those with lesser aspirations in the Śrāvaka vehicle. One should know that in the Mahāyāna system, the divisions are endless.

This concludes the sixth section on explaining the divisions of tantra classes from the general presentation of tantra classes.

Now, the second general topic - the presentation of how the Vajrayāna arose - has two parts:
1. Refuting others' misconceptions
2. Establishing the unique Mahāyāna position

The first has two parts:
1. The Śrāvaka position
2. The common Mahāyāna position

Both of these have six points:
1. How long accumulating collections
2. Time of awakening
3. Place
4. Method
5. Activities
6. How they remain after passing into nirvāṇa

These should be understood through two parts each:
1. Stating the previous position
2. Refuting it

Since writing extensively here would be overwhelming, the teacher will explain in detail.

The second general topic, establishing the unique Mahāyāna position, has six parts:
1. When the perfect Buddha attained awakening
2. Where it occurred
3. How enlightenment was attained

4. How the wheel of Mahāyāna Dharma was turned after awakening
5. The general way in which the Buddha performed limitless activities
6. Specifically, explaining the time of the emanated Buddha in the Sahā world realm and so forth

Regarding the first point on time: Master Śākyamitra claims that up until performing austerities as Sarvārthasiddha, son of King Śuddhodana, he was an independent bodhisattva. Then he attained awakening mentally in Akaniṣṭha, after which he displayed the manner of awakening here as an emanation. However, this is incorrect, as it contradicts the sūtra statement: "The Bhagavān attained complete awakening inconceivable eons ago and then displayed taking birth in the Śākya clan. "

Therefore, the Perfect Buddha attained awakening at the beginning of immeasurable eons ago. The emanated Buddha Śākyamuni later displayed the manner of awakening in this Fortunate Eon. This is accepted by most Mahāyāna masters like Vasubandhu, Candrakīrti, Ānandagarbha, and Bhavyakīrti, and is also accepted by our guru lineage. Thus, he attained awakening inconceivably many eons ago and still remains constantly present, as stated: "Supreme among the stable and eternal. "

2. Regarding place: It is called both the realm of Dense Array [Ghanavyūha] and the Akaniṣṭha realm. As Master Vāgīśvakīrti stated:
"In glorious Dense Array he realized ultimate truth,
He who became supreme among the Śākyas for the benefit of beings in Jambudvīpa. ".

From the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra it is also stated:
"In the delightful Akaniṣṭha,
Beyond the Pure Class,
The perfect Buddha attains awakening there,
While the emanation attains awakening here. "

Regarding the meaning of "Akaniṣṭha", Master Ānandagarbha explains in the introduction to the Tattvasaṃgraha commentary that when it says "The Bhagavān dwells in the realm of the King of Devas of Akaniṣṭha":

The "devas of Akaniṣṭha" refers to the primordial deities - they are the chief sons of Bhagavān Vairocana, the bodhisattvas of the tenth ground. Their realm is called the place where the first awakening occurred. When asked where this Akaniṣṭha realm is located, some uninformed people claim: "Akaniṣṭha refers to the highest of the Pure Abodes, and above those there exists another Akaniṣṭha realm of Maheśvara. " This is incorrect, as there is no scriptural source for such an explanation. Although there may be other realms above that, they are explained as abodes of tenth-ground bodhisattvas, not as places where the Saṃbhogakāya dwells. Therefore, all those are merely small world systems. Furthermore, since they depend on destruction, they are called "world systems" and are impermanent. But Dense Array is indestructible. As stated in the Vajraśekhara:

"This delightful Dense Array Akaniṣṭha
Is the indestructible Dense Array realm. There this manner of perfect enjoyment
Of the Buddhas' Dharma arises. "

Then what is it? It appears in the noble Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, where it is called "The Ground and Essence Adorned with Flower Ornaments" which includes inconceivable world systems like Sahā and others.

Such inconceivable [realms] contained within are called "ocean-like world systems. " These ocean-like world systems exist in the palm of Tathāgata Vairocana, the great ocean of primordial wisdom. The place where the Bhagavān dwells together with his retinue of great bodhisattvas is called the Dense Array realm, which is the abode of the perfect Saṃbhogakāya Buddha. All the parts within that are the abodes of emanated Buddhas (Nirmāṇakāya). Furthermore, according to different levels of understanding: to some, he appears to attain awakening in Jambudvīpa; to others, he attains awakening in Akaniṣṭha of the Pure Abodes and then performs activities; to some bodhisattvas, the Bhagavān manifestly attains awakening in four hundred million continents of the great trichiliocosm world system; to others, all the world systems of "The Ground and Essence Adorned with Flower Ornaments" are unified as a single Buddha-field. As stated in the Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka Tantra and the Noble Great Determination of Acala: "Then the Bhagavān filled all these world systems of the Ground and Essence Adorned with Flower Ornaments completely with light rays. " and so forth. Therefore, these various appearances according to different levels of understanding are the abodes of emanated Buddhas. If one thinks there might be even larger realms for the Saṃbhogakāya Buddha, while this cannot be refuted, it is not found explained in the sūtras, tantras, or treatises.

3. This was written based on explanations from the Avataṃsaka, Tattvasaṃgraha, Abhiṣeka Tantra and other scriptures, as well as the words of the gurus. Therefore, the entire space element in its vastness is the realm of the Dharmakāya. As stated in the Tattvasaṃgraha: "The Bhagavān Mahāvairocana constantly abides like space itself, and all his body, speech and mind are called the Vajra Tathāgata."

Therefore, while Buddhas are the Dharmakāya and since their aspirations and activities are limitless, their realms are also limitless. However, the definite measure of the realm explained above appears only to tenth-ground bodhisattvas who are called Saṃbhogakāya.

When it is explained that great bodhisattvas fully mature beings and completely purify Buddha-fields to that extent, what was taught above as "the abode of the King of Devas of Akaniṣṭha" refers to the abode where great bodhisattvas reach completion. These are explained in detail by the master.

3. How did the Teacher attain awakening in that place? This has two parts:
1. Following the path according to outer manifest awakening
2. Following the path according to inner manifest awakening

The first has two parts:
1. The actual manner in which the Teacher attained Buddhahood
2. How this establishes the unity of the three kāyas

These topics appear in the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra. Although the realm of the Dharmakāya of the Tathāgata is equal to space

Although the realm of the Dharmakāya of the Tathāgata is equal to space, a great bodhisattva called Sarvārthasiddhi, who had perfected the accumulations over countless eons, purified buddha-fields to that extent of the Saṃbhogakāya realm and matured that many sentient beings. Thinking "I too shall attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete enlightenment," he sat at the enlightenment seat of Glorious Dense Array and entered into the meditative concentration of immovability. Then all the Tathāgatas from all those realms came before that bodhisattva. Having manifested in the Saṃbhogakāya form, they roused that bodhisattva from the meditative concentration of immovability and said, "Son of noble family, how do you think you will manifest complete enlightenment of unsurpassed, perfect awakening?"

Then the bodhisattva arose, paid homage and said, "Blessed Ones, I do not know. Please teach me what is the true nature of the Tathāgatas and how should I accomplish it. "

All the Tathāgatas spoke in one voice: "Examine your own mind, rest in equipoise, and recite whatever mantra naturally arises," and gave other such instructions. Through the bodhisattva's meditative equipoise, he awakened through the nature of the five manifestations of enlightenment and the five wisdoms, and said to all the Tathāgatas, "Blessed Ones, I see that I am the embodiment of all Tathāgatas. ".

Then, through all the Tathāgatas entering his mind and all the Buddhas speaking in one voice, they established that enlightenment firmly. He became a Tathāgata, Arhat, perfectly complete Buddha who became the source of primordially luminous wisdom that is naturally the equality of all Tathāgatas in every way. Through that perfect complete enlightenment, the three kāyas were accomplished: The first and last manifestations of enlightenment accomplished the Dharmakāya, the second and third accomplished the Saṃbhogakāya, and the fourth accomplished the Nirmāṇakāya. Some assert that since the first is mirror-like, it also belongs to the Saṃbhogakāya. Some assert that after these manifestations of enlightenment occur in sequence, the four empowerments are bestowed and the four kāyas are attained. As stated in the Vajraśekhara:

"Then all the Buddhas emerge
From the heart center and
Through the four Dharma empowerments
The Sage receives initiation. The bodhicitta empowerment
That makes one Vajrasattva—
The fruition endowed with bodhicitta
Is the Vajrasattva empowerment. "

These refer to the empowerments of bodhicitta, generosity, wisdom and diligence. The four empowerments themselves are explained as the three kāyas:

"The Vajrasattva empowerment
Is held to be the Svabhāvikakāya. The Vajradharma empowerment
Is held to be the Saṃbhogakāya. The Vajraratna empowerment
Likewise gives the marks and signs. The great wisdom of all Buddhas,
With dharma-essence like space—
Through the Vajrakarma empowerment
Is held to be the Nirmāṇakāya. ".

Through the bestowal of the four secret empowerments,
Perfect buddhahood is attained.
Then through the name empowerment,
The Sage becomes Great Vairocana.
The dharmatā is perfectly realized,
The Dharmakāya and Saṃbhogakāya are fully realized.

The Dharmakāya is the inseparability of dharmadhātu-suchness and mind itself, free from all elaborations. The Svabhāvikakāya manifests as the nature of wisdom. The Saṃbhogakāya accomplishes one's own purpose, and the Nirmāṇakāya carries out its enlightened activities - these are the three. 

Furthermore, the Saṃbhogakāya is Vairocana while the Dharmakāya is Mahāvairocana. As stated in that very manifestation: "What is the difference between these two - Vairocana and Mahāvairocana? Vairocana is the essential form of the five Tathāgatas who attained perfect enlightenment in Akaniṣṭha realm, while Mahāvairocana is the non-dual mind and mental factors with that." Furthermore, Vairocana is called the Tathāgata's empowerment, while Mahāvairocana is called the Vajradhara's empowerment. The Nirmāṇakāya possesses both empowerments.

2. As for progressing in the manner of inner enlightenment, one progresses at the same time as the outer enlightenment. This appears in the Vajrapañjara: "It will be accomplished in one day, the ritual of two days..." Through methods like these, when the winds of the channels and bodhicitta become powerful in the central channel, one attains perfect enlightenment, as extensively explained in the tantric abhisamaya. Thus, this shows how the Teacher attained perfect enlightenment in the definitive meaning.

4. How did the Blessed One turn the wheel of Dharma? There are two aspects:
1. The unchanging wheel of Dharma of the Buddha's definitive meaning
2. The manner of turning the supreme wheel of Dharma for respective disciples in their respective places through emanations

The first has five aspects:
1. Place
2. Teacher
3. Assembly
4. Time
5. Perfect qualities of the teaching

1. The place is the realm of Dense Array (Akaniṣṭha) explained above.

2. The teacher is the perfectly complete Buddha possessing the nature of Dharmakāya and Saṃbhogakāya as explained above.

If one thinks: "If the Saṃbhogakāya teacher teaches Dharma to the assembly, how can the Dharmakāya teacher be a teacher when it does not teach Dharma?" Since the teacher's mind itself is the Dharmakāya, it is also a teacher. Moreover, the Dharmakāya itself takes form and teaches Dharma - that teacher is called Glorious Vajradhara. As stated in the Tattvasaṃgraha:

"How wonderful! I am self-arisen,
Showing the bodhisattva Samantabhadra.
Though not a body for teaching,
It becomes a bodhisattva's body."

Thus, having taken the form of Vajrasattva, he teaches the Dharma.

If one thinks: "In that case, wouldn't there be two teachers for one teaching?" There would not be, because those two are indivisible in essence. If they were divisible, how could the Dharmakāya manifest as a form?

Since those two are indivisible, how could they be separate? Therefore, as stated in the Candraguhyatilaka:

"I too am blessed by all the Buddhas
In desire and supreme form. I too bless all the Buddhas
In the supreme Dharmakāya. "

Thus there is only one teacher. Alternatively, even though the teacher appears as both a bodhisattva leading the assembly and as a Tathāgata teaching, there is no fault of there being two teachers. The assembly is of two types:
1. The assembly of Tathāgatas
2. The assembly of bodhisattvas

1. Regarding the first, it is as stated: "He saw all of space filled with Tathāgatas, just as a sesame pod is filled with sesame seeds. "

2. The second is as stated in expressions like "inexpressible numbers of even inexpressible numbers of bodhisattvas. "

Each of these has two types:
1. Emanated assembly
2. Assembly of distinct individuals

1. Regarding emanations, the Tattvasaṃgraha explains that Vajrasattva and all the Tathāgatas are emanated from Mahāvairocana, who is the nature of the Jñānakāya and its mind which is the Dharmakāya. The Vajraśekhara also states:

"How wonderful! Pure wisdom!
How wonderful! Buddha's śrāvakas!
How wonderful! This wheel of the dancer
Questions its own wisdom. "

And the Glorious Saṃpuṭa states:
"I am the teacher, I am also the Dharma,
I am also the assembly that possesses my qualities. "

The Sūtrālaṃkāra also states:
"This meaning of the three kāyas
Is taught along with their support. The Nirmāṇakāya is for others' benefit,
The Saṃbhogakāya for one's own benefit,
The Dharmakāya is taught for both benefits. ".

Thus since the Saṃbhogakāya is for one's own benefit, its assembly is also for one's own benefit. How do we know there are also assemblies of distinct individuals? This is taught in some sūtras, and also in the Uttaratantra: "The two conventional kāyas are for others' benefit. " It is also explained that the Saṃbhogakāya appears to bodhisattvas of the ten levels. Although the Tathāgatas are undifferentiated in the Dharmakāya, there are those who are liberated through distinct lineages. They all come together as one to make their intentions unified. The time is eternal abiding, as stated: "Stable, eternal, and supreme. " As stated in the latter part of the Saṃpuṭa Tantra: "The Bhagavān does not move from Akaniṣṭha. " The Dharma is the continual turning of the wheel of profound and vast Mahāyāna Dharma - the unchanging wheel of Dharma. 2. The supreme wheel of Dharma in individual places of emanation also has five aspects like before:

1. Teacher
2. Assembly  
3. Time
4. Place
5. Dharma

1. Regarding the first, the teacher: Although the Bhagavān's Saṃbhogakāya does not move from Akaniṣṭha, the way he turns the wheel of Dharma through individual emanations for different disciples in different places is like how when the moon rises in the sky, its reflection appears in all bodies of water. In particular, since this appears to those dwelling on the level of accomplishment and above, it is called the supreme Nirmāṇakāya. The emanated assemblies are like before, while the individual ones are those dwelling on the level of accomplishment and above.

How do we know this is so? This is known from the Emanation Teaching of the Victor of the Three Realms which states: "Having brought all beings of the three realms into the maṇḍala, they immediately attained accomplishment." The time is unceasing continuity. The place is not fixed. The Dharma is the Mahāyāna.

Furthermore, specifically regarding how this Saṃbhogakāya teacher Vairocana, after becoming enlightened, taught through his supreme emanations - where, when and what Dharma did he teach? Although generally these are limitless, to briefly mention some: Right after the Bhagavān became fully enlightened, he taught the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra. As stated in that very tantra: "Not long after Bhagavān Vairocana became fully enlightened" and "The mind of all Tathāgatas known as Samantabhadra" and "Going to wherever Mount Meru's peak is and wherever the celestial palaces are" and so forth, through emanations like the Vajradhātu emanation and others, he taught the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra.

Similarly, "The Bhagavān Mahāvajradhara, dwelling on a lion throne in the palace of the vast dharmadhātu, a place where many vidyādharas gather..."

Here is the translation of the given text, maintaining consistency with the previous summary and chunk:

And so forth - he taught the Vairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Tantra. And the Blessed One, dwelling in the wind, taught the Āryācala Tantra with words such as "all these world realms adorned with ground and essence, flower ornaments." Similarly, with words such as "the Blessed One dwelling in the empowerment palace," he taught the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra in places adorned with ground and essence, flower ornaments. Likewise, with words such as "the Blessed One dwelling in the abode of Paranirmitavaśavartin, lord of gods," he taught the Śrīparamādya Tantra. Similarly, dwelling in the Pure Abodes, he taught the Catuḥpīṭha Tantra with words such as "The All-Knowing One spoke thus." Likewise, with words such as "the Blessed One dwelling in the bhaga of the vajra consort of body, speech and mind of all Tathāgatas," he taught the Śrīguhyasamāja and other tantras. And with words such as "Dwelling always as the essence of all in the supreme secret delight," he taught the Cakrasaṃvara Tantra and others. In brief, he taught innumerable sūtras and tantras through different arrangements of body and speech. Moreover, in a single place at a single time, he taught inconceivable different Dharmas to different disciples. As stated in the Dgongs pa lung ston pa'i rgyud:

"The single vajra word,
Free from concepts and confusion,
Pleasing to the mind,
Becomes many distinctions
According to disciples' dispositions."

5. The general explanation of how the Buddha performed infinite enlightened activities:
Although turning the wheel of Dharma as explained above is also an activity, it is discussed separately since it is primary. Those and other activities are infinite. These can be condensed into five:

1. The performer of activities
2. The cause of activities  
3. Time
4. Place

1. The performer of activities refers to the perfect, complete Buddha Śrī Vairocana who was explained above, the one who possesses both Dharmakāya and Rūpakāya. He is singular, as stated in the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra: "In that world realm, there is only Tathāgata Vairocana who abides there through the power of previous aspirations. " If one asks whether there are absolutely no other teachers, while they appear to us as taught in scripture, we cannot negate the existence of countless others since there are many who are liberated through different lineages and there are as many buddha-fields as there are atoms in a single atom. 2. The cause of activities is the force of non-referential great compassion and the aspirations made under its influence. As stated in the Buddha Samāyoga:
"Arising from the force of stainless compassion always,
The nature of fulfilled aspirations unceasing,
Boundlessly striving to accomplish beings' welfare,
The essence of great compassion, Vairocana always manifests. "

3. Regarding how long he performs activities for beings: Having attained buddhahood inconceivable eons ago, he remains as long as the realm of beings is not empty, and during that time performs activities for beings uninterruptedly. As it states: "Arising from the force of stainless compassion always. "

Similarly, Ācārya Candrakīrti also states in the Madhyamakāvatāra:
"However many subtle atomic particles exist
In all the separate buddha-fields in all directions,
That many eons the supreme enlightened ones proceed toward perfect awakening. ".

However, this secret is not a basis to explain to others. As stated:
"O Victor, as long as all worlds are supremely pacified,
As long as beings are not extinct and space does not disintegrate,
How could you, born from the mother of wisdom and nurtured by compassion,
Ever enter into complete peace in an improper way?"

4. Regarding the place where activities are performed, focusing on what is primary:

As stated in the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra, after explaining the world realms in sequence: "In that world realm, Bhagavān Vairocana previously purified it when practicing the bodhisattva's conduct." While some world realms are forming, some are disintegrating, and some are abiding, he primarily benefits all beings in all those realms because they were previously taken under his care due to having the proper karma. Moreover, since there are no obstacles to the Tathāgata's wisdom, aspirations and compassion, he pervades all of space. As stated in the Buddha Samāyoga:
"In all reaches of space, the glorious
Vajrasattva perfectly abides.
Through the power of supreme accomplishment,
He enters into all as their very nature."

5. Regarding how he performs activities: He remains present performing various methods of benefit for each being individually. As stated in the Empowerment Tantra: "Bhagavān Vairocana abides in the form of reflections before all beings in all world realms." Also, in a single moment he performs boundless activities for beings in different places. As stated in the Śrī Saṃpuṭa:

"In some places he generates the great enlightened mind,
In some he follows after conduct,
In some he manifests perfect enlightenment,
In some he turns the wheel [of Dharma]. "

And as stated in the Jñānabindu:
"In some places he composes tantras and treatises,
While in others he upholds them. "

Thus from beginningless time, the single Bhagavān performs benefit through inconceivable emanations. If one wonders whether this refers to the equality of dharmatā, it does not. As stated in the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment: "When that Bhagavān previously practiced the bodhisattva's conduct. "

This teaches that it refers to that very same Bhagavān in that world realm. These boundless times, boundless places, and boundless activities are difficult even to have faith in for those of lesser minds who are untrained. This is clearly taught by Ācārya Candrakīrti. Also, from the mouth of Ācārya Nāgārjuna, in the Sūtrasamuccaya: "Faith in the vastness of all buddhas and bodhisattvas is extremely difficult to attain," which is stated as the ultimate teaching. Therefore:
"Though the Bhagavān's vast qualities are beyond conceptual mind,
Through the guru's power and scriptures, I express a mere fraction with faithful mind. The noble ones rejoice in explaining secrets,
Yet may the fierce retinue please be patient. "
This is an interlude verse. Thus since his compassion that performs benefit never tires, and the beings to be benefited are limitless, his activities continue uninterruptedly and constantly. Therefore, these too are the perfect Buddha. 6. General meaning.

Now I will explain the specific details of those activities, particularly the time when the Nirmāṇakāya Buddha appears in the Sahā world realm. Although this is taught in eight parts, for ease of understanding it will be presented in five:

1. The manner in which the Nirmāṇakāya appears
2. The manner in which the retinue appears around that
3. The manner in which he turns the wheel of Dharma
4. How the teachings were compiled
5. How they spread among humans

The first, the manner of appearing, has four parts:
1. Place
2. Time
3. How he attained enlightenment 
4. His activities

First, regarding place: Although in general it is inconceivable as explained above, for now we will focus on the Sahā world realm. And within that, we will specifically focus on Jambudvīpa, the southern continent among the four continents at the center.

Second, regarding time: Although this too is inconceivable, we will focus on the Excellent Eon. Furthermore, after the Teacher attained enlightenment in the definitive sense and turned the wheel of Dharma of the profound and vast teachings like the Vajrayāna, then Śākyamuni appeared in Jambudvīpa. This is taught in the Noble Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra, where after teaching the root tantra, subsequent tantra, and final subsequent tantra, at the time of teaching the condensed tantra it states:

"Having descended among humans,
For the purpose and benefit of all beings,
Turn the supreme vajra wheel
And accomplish [their welfare], O Protector."

Then he proceeded from the peak of Mount Meru to where the essence of enlightenment was. As stated: "The Bhagavān took grass in order to act in accordance with the world near the Bodhi tree," and so forth.

Also from the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra: "After the great bodhisattva Samantabhadra empowered Vajrapāṇi in the world realm adorned with the ground and essence flower ornaments, then in this Sahā world realm, the Bhagavān known as Śākyamuni conquered Māra in Jambudvīpa of the four-continent intermediate world realm and manifested perfect enlightenment."

3. Regarding how the Teacher attained enlightenment: Although the Teacher, the Tathāgata Nirmāṇakāya, had already attained buddhahood in his essential nature, he again demonstrated the manner of attaining enlightenment in order to act in accordance with the world. This is the nature of all buddhas. As stated in the Tattvasaṃgraha:

"The gods said: 'Friends, although he had already attained perfect enlightenment before, he acts in accordance with the world and again demonstrates unsurpassed enlightenment.' From there until: 'Then that night he conquered Māra and at dawn manifested perfect, complete enlightenment of unsurpassed, genuine, complete buddhahood and benefited the entire realm of beings.'"

If one thinks "In that case, Ācārya Śākyamitra's tradition is correct since it marks the point from 'took grass' or 'that night,'" that is incorrect. From the Empowerment Tantra:

As stated in the Empowerment Tantra: "After the empowerment, starting from when he dwelt in the Tuṣita realm, and having progressively practiced the conduct and been blessed until the ultimate great parinirvāṇa, he taught the Dharma. "

4. Regarding his activities: From when the Teacher, the Tathāgata, dwelt in Tuṣita until his parinirvāṇa, he performed eight, twelve, sixteen, or inconceivable deeds. These common activities should be understood according to the Lalitavistara Sūtra and others. 2. The manner in which the retinue appeared has two parts:
1. In general, what kind of retinue was suitable
2. Specifically, how the compilers appeared

1. In general, those who were taken under the care of Bhagavān Vairocana and for whom aspirations were made were matured by the bodhisattvas and reached the level of the great path of accumulation or higher. This applies to both those of śrāvaka lineage and bodhisattva lineage. Some reached the great path of accumulation, some reached heat, some reached peak, some reached acceptance, some reached supreme dharma, and some from the path of seeing up to attaining the great bodhisattva levels. These were those who took birth together in one favorable situation. If one thinks "This is incorrect for those above the path of accumulation, since there were many who had wrong views even after seeing the Buddha, and many who were born in hell realms," that is not so. Although some maintained wrong views until seeing the truth due to being influenced by negative spiritual friends and being obscured by karmic obscurations.

Until attaining acceptance, some even went to the lower realms. If one wonders "What is the purpose of them seeing the Buddha?" it makes their karmic obscurations subtler and brings them to maturity.

2. Specifically, regarding how the compilers appeared: The Bhagavān himself is suitable as a compiler since he comprehends all dharmas, while others are not. This comprehension of dharmas refers to having mastery over inconceivable wisdom, not anything else. In general, the śrāvakas do not have the confidence to teach dharma without the Buddha's power, while the bodhisattvas teach in the presence of the Tathāgatas through their own confidence. However, none of these are suitable as compilers. So who is suitable? The bodhisattvas who are emanated from the Bhagavān's enlightened mind.

Furthermore, in the Gaṇḍavyūha, Vajrasattva is described as the beginningless and endless enlightened mind, the lord of all Tathāgatas, who abides in form body. As taught above: "Oh, I am the self-arisen one..." He entrusted Bodhisattva Samantabhadra as the lord of teachings in the world realm adorned with flower essences.

He made aspirations to take different births during the times of worlds forming and dissolving. In this Sahā world realm during the Excellent Eon, he is the yakṣa chief Vajrapāṇi, the lord of all secret teachings and all doctrines. As stated in the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra: "Having blessed Bodhisattva Samantabhadra..."

Having blessed him, as stated: "He was blessed to take births according to the power of time in order to maintain the uninterrupted continuity of Buddha's activities from one to the next," and "Having empowered Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, the teachings were entrusted to him. "

Furthermore, from the same text: "Bodhisattva Samantabhadra made aspirations to demonstrate the previous activities of Bhagavān Vairocana in all world realms adorned with flower essences. Taking control over the power of taming yakṣas, he dwelt in the central Jambudvīpa, in the great yakṣa chief's abode at Vaiśālī in this Sahā world realm. "

As stated in the Uncommon Secret: "For humans, it was the Elder Ānanda. " And as taught: "Now I will explain the perfect retinue of the completely perfect Buddha: Mañjuśrī became King Śuddhodana, Lokeśvara became the goddess Māyādevī, Samantabhadra became the Elder Ānanda," and so forth. Thus, the qualities, activities, empowerments and other aspects of the compilers should be understood from the Empowerment Cause Tantra, the Inconceivable Secret Sūtra, and others. 3. If one asks how the Bhagavān turned the wheel of Dharma:

This has two parts:
1. How he turned the wheel of common dharma
2. How he turned the wheel of the uncommon Vajrayāna

The first has two parts:
1. 1 Refuting others' wrong views
1. 2 Expressing our own position.

1.1 Regarding refuting others' wrong views:
Some uninformed people say that the Bhagavān turned the wheel of Dharma in three stages:

First, in Vārāṇasī, he turned the wheel of the Four Noble Truths, teaching provisional meaning for those of śrāvaka disposition. Since this led to excessive clinging to existence, second, at Vulture Peak and other places, he turned the wheel of Dharma teaching emptiness and non-essence, showing things lack inherent existence. Since this led to excessive clinging to non-existence, finally, at Śrāvastī and other places, starting from non-essence, he turned the third wheel, the definitive meaning that makes fine distinctions.

As explained in the Noble Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra: "First, in Vārāṇasī, the Bhagavān turned the previously unturned wheel of Dharma by teaching the aspects of the Four Noble Truths to those properly engaged in the Śrāvaka vehicle. That wheel had something higher, was provisional meaning, and became a source of dispute. Second, based on the lack of inherent existence of phenomena, the Bhagavān turned the wheel of Dharma through expressions of emptiness for those properly engaged in the Mahāyāna. That wheel too had something higher, was provisional meaning, and became a source of dispute. Third, based on the lack of inherent existence of phenomena, the Bhagavān turned the wheel of Dharma with fine distinctions, possessing great wonder, for those properly engaged in all vehicles. This wheel of Dharma had nothing higher, was definitive meaning, and did not become a source of dispute." And from the Prajñāpāramitā

From the Prajñāpāramitā it is also stated: "Alas! The second wheel of Dharma has been turned in the world," they claim.

This is incorrect. If it were true that he turned three different types of Dharma wheels, then their claim that these were turned sequentially in different places would be illogical. Why is it illogical? Because it contradicts scripture and reasoning, does not resolve the śrāvakas' disputes, becomes a deprecation of the Sugata, and has many other faults.

1.2 Expressing our own position:
We assert the following: As stated in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra, at the time of establishing the Mahāyāna: "What was previously unexplained arose simultaneously." And from the Prophecy Sūtra: 
"Non-conceptual and undisturbed,
Pleasant single vajra words,
Due to the dispositions of those to be tamed,
Manifest in many different ways."

Thus, at a single time, one speech of the Bhagavān appeared as different teachings to different disciples. This does not contradict the scriptural citation from the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra mentioned earlier, since that scripture speaks of different teachings but does not mention different places or times. Therefore, teaching different dharmas to disciples through one speech at a single time is called the "array of speech," while displaying many different forms in different places simultaneously is accomplishing benefit through the "array of form."

2. How he turned the wheel of the uncommon Vajrayāna has two parts:
2.1 How it was actually turned
2.2 Dispelling objections to that

2.1 Although one should understand that the secret mantra was also taught according to the same way of turning the wheel of Dharma described above

However, when explained in detail: In general, all secret mantras were first taught by the supreme Nirmāṇakāya before Śākyamuni, as explained earlier.

Among these, some were later repeated by Śākyamuni, some were not repeated later, and some were taught by his other emanations. As for those that were repeated, for example in the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment Tantra: First, he taught the introductory chapter about empowering Samantabhadra in the world realm adorned with ground and essence flower ornaments. Then he taught the chapter about empowering Vajrapāṇi in the noble city in the Sahā realm.

Similarly, the common tantras that mention "Present places like Jambudvīpa, the Dharma wheel places, Vaiśālī, Śvetadvīpa, and divine realms" along with the five groups of attendants and others were taught through the array of speech. The teachings given at uncommon places like the glorious Dhānyakaṭaka stūpa and to uncommon retinues were taught through the array of form. These were thus repeated later.

There are also those that were not repeated later. For example, after first teaching the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra and completing that tantra, it shows activities like "Having descended among humans" and coming to Jambudvīpa. The glorious Cakrasaṃvara Tantra was also not repeated later, according to Ācārya Bhavyakīrti.

From the commentary on the Śrī Cakrasaṃvara Root Tantra:

This is a teaching of infinite continuity - it existed before Buddha Śākyamuni himself. When the Prajñāpāramitā and other teachings disappeared due to the power of time through fire kalpas and so forth, Buddha Śākyamuni taught them again. However, this was not the case with Śrī Cakrasaṃvara.

As explained, it did not disappear because it was practiced by the vīras, ḍākinīs and others in inexpressible buddha realms. Most of the tantras like the Guhyasamāja were taught by his other emanations. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja: "Then Vajrapāṇi, lord of all tathāgatas, spoke to all the tathāgatas and bodhisattvas: 'O Bhagavān, even after countless kalpas equal to the smallest particles in all buddha realms of all the past tathāgatas have passed, from the time of Buddha Dīpaṃkara until Buddha Mahākāśyapa, this was not taught. Why? Because at the time of explaining the meaning of the great secret abode, beings did not have the fortune.'" Some masters say that since it states "not taught until Kāśyapa," it implies by extension that Śākyamuni did teach it.

If one asks, "Then where did this Vajra Queen's bhaga come from?" Some say, "Since it was taught while the Bhagavān was in his mother's womb, it is called the Vajra Queen's bhaga." But this is incorrect.

If asked why this is incorrect:

If one asks why this is incorrect: it is not explained in the tantras, commentaries, or treatises, nor is it a well-known oral tradition. Therefore, it should be understood as something fabricated by those who make things up.

Other masters say there is this well-known story: When the Bhagavān was residing in the great city of Śrāvastī, at that time, three hundred leagues away there was a country called Oḍḍiyāna where there lived a king named Indrabhūti.

One morning, he saw many monks traveling through the sky and did not know who they were. When he asked his ministers, they also did not know. Then when he asked the city people, one of them said: "Three hundred leagues from here is a city called Śrāvastī where there dwells one who has become a buddha, the son of King Śuddhodana. These must be his followers." Upon hearing this, the king developed faith merely from hearing the word "buddha." He bowed in that direction and with joined palms holding flowers, he sat and saw the Bhagavān dwelling in Śrāvastī with his retinue.

Faith arose in him and he prayed: "Bhagavān, omniscient one full of compassion, since you possess miraculous feet, please come here tomorrow at noon." The next day at noon, the Bhagavān came with his retinue. After the king and his attendants made offerings, they requested: "Please liberate us from the suffering of existence." The Bhagavān replied: "Go forth from household life into homelessness and there will be a method."

The king requested: "Since we have great torment from the objects of desire, please teach us a method of liberation without abandoning these." At that time, in order to guide those beings with strong desire, the Bhagavān dwelt in the bhaga of the vajra consort and, while in the midst of the assembly of consorts, empowered King Indrabhūti, thereby liberating him at that very moment. Similarly, by teaching the Vajrayāna dharma, he liberated the king and his retinue, then entrusted the teachings to the Lord of Secrets and they were compiled. This is what some claim.

Others say: "That well-known story is from the time of the compilation of the dharma, but this enumeration of teachings should be understood as having beginningless causes. How so?

As taught in the Glorious Jñānabindu Tantra: 'In future times, the authentic secret tantras will be explained to beings who possess the proper fortune. The Lord Vajrapāṇi will give the explanations.

In endless world realms,
He is the cause of birth and destruction.
The great protector Vajrapāṇi,
Lord of all vajra holders,
Is free from birth and cessation,
The supreme self-arisen sovereign.
To some he appears in buddha form,
To some in heruka form,
For some he composes tantras and treatises,
And for some he holds them.'

Thus it is clear that even before the arising of worldly creation and destruction and so forth, in order to guide those with desire, the Bhagavān manifested in forms such as the consort's bhaga and taught, which was later compiled by Vajrapāṇi. The Glorious Siddhi Guhya explains that the previous story was about the compilation, which will be explained below. Furthermore, some masters say:"

Some masters say, as taught in the "Perfect Names":

"It was taught by buddhas of the past,
Will be taught by those yet to come,
And what the perfect buddhas of the present
Teach again and again. "

Thus, it was taught from the beginning and is taught by present buddhas, so it has been taught continuously. 2. Regarding objections to how the secret mantras were taught, there are two points:
2. 1 Resolving contradictions about when they were taught
2. 2 Resolving contradictions about who taught them

2. 1 First, if one objects that there is a contradiction between the explanation in the "Perfect Names" that all buddhas of the three times taught it and the explanation in the Guhyasamāja that it was not taught from Dīpaṃkara until Kāśyapa:

Some followers of Ācārya Jñānapāda explain that the statement about teaching refers to the Saṃbhogakāya Buddha, while the statement about not teaching refers to the Nirmāṇakāya Buddha - meaning either the Nirmāṇakāya did not teach it, or that Vajrapāṇi himself did not teach it during that period. The term "during that period" does not preclude it being taught before or after. Others say the statement about teaching refers to secret mantra in general, while the statement about not teaching refers specifically to the Guhyasamāja alone. Furthermore, according to many masters like Ācārya Candrakīrti, the statement about teaching refers to the definitive meaning, while the statement about not teaching is merely praise of the greatness of the glorious Guhyasamāja. For example, it is like when it is said "Although all buddhas turned the dharma wheel, it did not appear in the world. ".

Some follow Ācārya Āryādeva's position, who states in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa: "It would not make sense for methods of accomplishment to arise first as lamp-like auxiliaries compiled from authentic tantras. During the Perfect, Triple, and Double Ages, beings possessed excellent qualities and understood reality through the extensive tantra words and hidden terminology. But now is the Age of Strife." Since this explains that Śākyamuni appeared in the Age of Strife but treatises were prohibited while tantras existed in the Perfect Age and so forth, it implies the tantras existed before Śākyamuni.

2.2 Resolving contradictions about who taught them:

If they existed before Śākyamuni, one might object: Don't verses like "The supreme Lion of the Śākyas conquered the powerful hosts of powerful Māra's forces, turned the wheel [of Dharma] and passed into nirvāṇa" only mention Śākyamuni's name? Although his name appears, this refers to the previous Buddha Vairocana who is none other than the present Śākyamuni - there is no difference between them. The compiler either stated it this way to negate their separateness or for ease of identification. For example, even the countless past deeds of Ārya Maudgalyāyana...

2.2 Resolving contradictions about who taught them:

Even the countless previous lives of Ārya Maudgalyāyana, as the Bhagavān explained, ripened and were experienced by Maudgalyāyana himself - not in earth, water, fire, or wind. Therefore, there is no contradiction in using Śākyamuni's name.

4. Regarding how the teachings were compiled, there are three points:
1. The compilation by the Śrāvakas, which arose incidentally 
2. The compilation of the Mahāyāna
3. How the secret mantras were compiled

First, all the Śrāvaka collections were compiled by five hundred arhats gathered at the cave called Vimalayāna. The sūtras were compiled by Ānanda, the Vinaya by Upāli, and the Abhidharma by Ārya Kāśyapa.

Second, regarding the compilation of Mahāyāna sūtras, some masters claim they were compiled by ninety billion bodhisattvas gathered in the southern region called Vimalasambhava. While this is not a major error, both the unique secret mantras and Mahāyāna were actually compiled by Vajrapāṇi himself. For example, Ācārya Vasubandhu explains in his commentary on the Pāramitā texts that when Ārya Maitreya questioned Bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, he acknowledged before the assembly that he had heard this Prajñāpāramitā. As for them being compiled in different places:

This can neither be refuted nor proven.

3. Regarding how the secret mantras were compiled, there are two points:
1. Refuting others' misconceptions 
2. Stating our own position 

First, some here say that according to the Glorious Uttaratantra:
"When I am no longer visible,
After one hundred and twelve years..."

In verse:
"This supreme essence of the teachings,
Renowned in three divine realms,
In the southeastern direction of Jambudvīpa,
Upon a mountain called Glory,
Through compassionate blessings in accord,
To a king known as Ja,
Vajrapāṇi will bestow. The holy fortunate ones among humans
Will achieve supreme enlightenment,
Therefore always be respectful to this. "

Thus some say this appears in texts. Therefore, twenty years after Śākyamuni passed into nirvāṇa, in the southeastern direction in the land of Zahor called Oḍḍiyāna, countless volumes written in melted vaidurya on golden pages descended onto the palace of a king called Ja, or Indrabhūti. Some say the king understood them by looking at them and achieved accomplishment through practice. Some say the king did not understand them, so he invited a monk called Kukure. He also did not understand them until he comprehended the chapter on seeing Vajrasattva's face. Through practicing this, he saw Vajrasattva's face and then understood all eighteen tantra classes. Then the king and his retinue achieved accomplishment, and it spread to others. There are many such stories that I have not written down. If one asks why I do not investigate these, it is because these are mere fabrications composed by those who make things up as they please. If one asks how these are fabrications - while the statement that "Vajrapāṇi will teach King Ja" cannot be refuted, [the claims about] achieving accomplishment just by looking at the texts contradicts the statement:

"Those who take up secret mantras by themselves
Will only journey to the hells. "

It also contradicts the explanation that there can be no accomplishment without a guru.

Moreover, saying that "southeastern direction" refers to the land of Oḍḍiyāna contradicts both worldly convention and direct perception. Who could write down all the many false statements like these? Therefore, these should be abandoned. Similarly, there are many contradictions in their explanations of the classifications of tantra classes and so forth. Since their refutation can be understood elsewhere, I have not written it here.

If one asks how to interpret this quotation from the Saṃvara Uttaratantra: The statement "Renowned in three divine realms" is from the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra, which prophesies how Vajrapāṇi bestowed empowerment through a manifestation maṇḍala upon King Prasenacandra in a city called Patikīrti in the southeastern direction and turned the wheel of Dharma. However, it does not prophesy that the teachings were compiled in Oḍḍiyāna.

2. Stating One's Own Position:
If one asks how the vehicle of secret mantras was compiled, according to what I have heard from my teachers and what appears in the tantras: From the Glorious Jñānabindu Tantra: "Who will explain the secret tantras to fortunate beings in future times?" The response: "Lord Vajrapāṇi will explain them."

And from the Guhyapradīpa Yoginī Tantra: "Who will understand and explain the great secret tantras in the future?" The response: "In the glorious great vajra place in the western land of Oḍḍiyāna, King Indrabhūti will understand them, explain them, and make them clear to beings." Question: "Is King Indrabhūti a lord of the ten bhūmis?"

The response states: "In the Glorious Jñānabindu Tantra King, who is being praised? It is explained that 'Vajrapāṇi, the wisdom body, lord of the ten bhūmis, manifests as a nirmāṇakāya and is a lord of the ten bhūmis.'"

Therefore, the place of compilation was Oḍḍiyāna. The compiler was Vajrapāṇi. The time was when the Blessed One had not yet passed into nirvāṇa. This story was already discussed above regarding how Indrabhūti made his request to the Blessed One while residing in Śrāvastī.

As for how it was compiled: The Blessed One manifested in the form of one with desire and, having inclined the minds of those with desire, bestowed empowerment on all worthy ones and ripened the tantras. Then Vajrapāṇi, the lord of all Tathāgatas, taught. As stated in the Glorious Guhyasiddhi: "Having become a form adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being, with a wisdom-illusion nature and vajra mind, saying 'Thus I have heard' and so forth, he reveals himself to ultimate reality, the buddhas and bodhisattvas." And it is said: "There are no other compilers than this one alone. The composer of tantras is Vajra Mind."

Therefore, those who have faith in the definitive meaning should understand that expressions like "Thus I have heard" establish the structure of the tantras and are to be practiced. Those of lesser intellect understand it to mean that Lord Vajrapāṇi heard it from the Blessed One and then compiled it. Thus the story goes.

Therefore, according to the stories and the expression "Thus I have heard, he teaches to the buddhas and bodhisattvas," it is known that the compilation took place while the Blessed One was still alive. Thus, Vajrapāṇi compiled all the tantra classes and gave them to the king and his retinue. They achieved accomplishment and naturally became known as vīras and yoginīs. That land of Oḍḍiyāna became empty and a great lake filled with nāgas appeared there.

Then again Vajrapāṇi wrote all the tantras on golden pages with melted vaidurya. After ripening the great nāgas in that land's lake, Vajrapāṇi entrusted the volumes of tantras to them. Then those nāgas gradually transformed into human form and built cities on the shores of the lake. Through practicing the Vajrayāna, most of them achieved accomplishment. Those who did not achieve accomplishment became humans. Most of the women became ḍākinīs. Even today this story is well known, and it is called "The Sacred Land of the Oḍḍiyāna Ḍākinīs."

Then the kings of that land also became completely dharmic. This gradually transformed, and this story is clear in the commentary on Sahajasiddhi. Some even say that today's [kings] are of the lineage of the first King Indrabhūti, but this was added later. Thus the northern land of Oḍḍiyāna is called "The Source of Qualities."

5. How the teachings spread to other lands: 

In the southern region there was a king called Visukalpa who followed the Śrāvaka vehicle. In a dream he heard: "Go to Oḍḍiyāna. In this life you will attain [the state of] Vajradhara. " Upon waking, he went without doubt. In Oḍḍiyāna he met a woman and served her. Through her blessings, she gave him the Guhyasamāja and Tattvasaṃgraha. He brought these back and spread them in the southern region. Similarly, many masters brought numerous tantra classes from Oḍḍiyāna. It is said that the master Mahāsiddha Ḍombī Heruka brought the Hevajra Tantra. Some say that Master Nāgārjuna disguised himself as a fool and stole it. This is laughable. If one asks why it is laughable:

It would be disparaging the master, since one without magical powers cannot steal from a first bhūmi bodhisattva. It would be disparaging the ḍākinīs, since how could there be librarians who would not recognize whether someone was Nāgārjuna or a thief?

It would also disparage one's own dharma, since the lineage would come from stolen texts. Similarly, Master Kukuripa brought the Mahāmāyā Tantra. Likewise, Master Lalitavajra brought the Vajrabhairava Tantra, and there are inconceivably many others. The histories of the masters and how the tantras were translated in Tibet should be learned elsewhere. This presentation of how the secret mantras arose
I have primarily based on the words of the gurus,
Well-compiled from various tantras, sūtras and treatises,
Avoiding personal fabrication, gathered in one place.

Through this clarification, may the noble ones be pleased!

This concludes the seventh section on how the secret mantras arose from the general presentation of the tantra classes. Thus ends the first chapter, which presents the general system of tantra classes in seven sections. Now, the second general topic will explain the meaning of the term tantra. This has two parts:
1. The meaning content of tantra
2. The verbal expression of tantra

The first has five parts:
1. Explaining what is generally meant by the term tantra
2. Its threefold division
3. The system of establishing the definitions of these three
4. Establishing the individual tantras as method, wisdom, and so forth
5. Establishing them as king and so forth

1. Generally, tantra refers to one's own mind as non-dual primordial wisdom. It is called tantra because the continuity of contaminated mind flows uninterruptedly from beginningless time until buddhahood. Thus the Later Guhyasamāja Tantra and the Vajraśekhara state: "Tantra means continuous succession. "

The Māyājāla states: "Tantra means continuum. "

2. The threefold division: This mind itself becomes the causal tantra, method tantra, and resultant tantra:
1. The state of beings in saṃsāra is the causal tantra
2. The middle stage of entering the path is the method tantra  
3. Attaining the wisdom body of enlightenment is the resultant tantra

Similarly, the Later Guhyasamāja Tantra states:
"Tantra means continuous succession,
That continuum has three aspects:
The basis, its nature,
And that which is unassailable. Nature in its aspects is the cause,
The basis is what is called method. ".

Similarly, the unassailable is the result - 
These three summarize the meaning of tantra.

3. The system of establishing the definitions of these three:

Regarding cause: Although not directly present now, it refers to the potential that can produce results when meeting with conditions, like seeds residing in a vessel. Therefore, though our mind has not actually achieved buddhahood now, since it can give rise to buddhahood when meeting with methods, it is called the cause of buddhahood. As the Hevajra states:
"Beings are themselves buddhas,
Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
When these are removed, they are buddha indeed."

How does this function as a continuum? Although temporarily it manifests as the six realms and so forth, as various paths of ripening and liberation, and as various results, since the essential nature of mind remains unchanged and uninterrupted, it is a continuum. As the Guhyasamāja states:
"As long as space endures,  
For that long mind endures."

Method refers to that which serves as the means to bring forth the result from the cause, like fertilizer. Therefore, the paths of ripening and liberation along with their branches are called method. 

As the Glorious Saṃpuṭa states:
"To increase beings' wisdom,
Methods were taught by the buddhas."

How is method a continuum? Because the lineage of instructions is uninterrupted and because the experience of samādhi is uninterrupted.

As the Saṃpuṭa also states:
"The treatises, valid teachers,
Those following scripture who know reality,
And the actual secret meaning -
Know these to be transmitted one to another."

The Hevajra states:
"Like the continuous flow of a river,
And like the bound tip of a butter lamp. "

Though beginners lack continuous meditative equipoise, there is continuity through post-meditation activities and through the impetus of initial mind-generation, as the Bodhicaryāvatāra states:
"Many arise uninterruptedly,
Equal to the extent of space. "

Result refers to the actualization of what exists potentially in the cause, like a ripened flower. Therefore, when mind itself becomes established as buddha, this is called the result. As the Saṃpuṭa states:
"The fruition meaning of the buddhas
Is the yoga desired by the eight. "

How is this result a continuum? It is a continuum because it is uninterrupted. As the Sūtrālaṃkāra states:
"Natural and uninterrupted,
These are eternal through continuity. "

The dharmakāya is a continuum because it is naturally permanent and unchanging. The saṃbhogakāya is a continuum because the enjoyment of dharma is uninterrupted. The nirmāṇakāya is a continuum because the wheel of enlightened activities and deeds is uninterrupted. Thus the Glorious Saṃpuṭa states: "Called perpetual activity" and "The Blessed One does not pass away from Akaniṣṭha" and "The Blessed One, who is completely pure, dwells together with beings in saṃsāra, moving through their mindstreams and turning many dharma doors. "

Having thus explained what tantra means in general, now the specific meaning of individual tantras will be explained. Regarding the names of tantras, they are mostly designated based on the resultant tantra of enlightened wisdom of the perfectly complete buddhas, and then implicitly applied to the method tantra and causal tantra.

For example, tantras like the Glorious Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, and Sampuṭa. Some are named from both the resultant tantra and method tantra, like the Tattvasaṃgraha. Some are named solely from the method tantra, like the Susiddhikara. Similarly, some are named after the requester, like Subāhu. Some are named according to the text's length, like the Five Hundred Thousand Tantra, and there are many other such examples.

Regarding the term "Hevajratantra": As stated in the tantra:
"He means great compassion itself,
Vajra refers to wisdom.
The tantra embodies method and wisdom—
Listen as I explain this."

"He" means compassion, which is method. "Vajra" is wisdom, being similar to that. Therefore, "Hevajra" refers to the unity of the buddhas' non-conceptual great compassion and great wisdom—this is the resultant tantra. Since the path that accomplishes such a result must also be Hevajra, and the cause must also be Hevajra, all three tantras are Hevajra. As Dignāga explained:
"The non-dual perfection of wisdom
Is the wisdom of the Tathāgatas.
Through union with that goal to be accomplished,
The text and path also bear that name."

Now, what is the non-dual method and wisdom of the causal Hevajra? As stated in the Later Guhyasamāja Tantra:
"The union of wisdom and method
Is explained as yoga.
That which is without entities is wisdom,
Method has the characteristic of entities."

The manifestation of various dualistic appearances such as apprehended objects and apprehending subjects is method—this is saṃsāra. That very nature being free from all elaborations is wisdom—this is nirvāṇa. The inseparability of these two is the causal Hevajra tantra. As it is also stated:

"Without abandoning saṃsāra,
Nirvāṇa cannot be realized elsewhere. Form, sound and other phenomena of saṃsāra—
These phenomena are nirvāṇa. "

The non-dual method and wisdom of the method tantra are the samādhis of ripening and liberation paths along with their branches, which arise through the blessing of the causal tantra abiding in that way. Moreover:
1. In the ripening path, empowerment is method
2. In the liberation path, the generation and completion stages are wisdom
3. In empowerment:
    3. 1 The vase empowerment is method
    3. 2 The three higher empowerments are wisdom
4. In the liberation path:
    4. 1 The generation stage is method
    4. 2 The completion stage is wisdom
5. In the generation stage:
    5. 1 The father aspect is method
    5. 2 The mother aspect is wisdom
6. In completion:
    6. 1 With reference points is method
    6. 2 Without reference points is wisdom

Each of these has many aspects of method and wisdom. In brief, there is nothing that is not method and wisdom. There are many divisions of these and many scriptural citations for their various methods and wisdoms, but fearing it would be too lengthy, I have not written them here. Thus, the path method tantra is Hevajra. The non-dual method and wisdom of the resultant tantra are:
1. The form kāyas are called method
2. The dharmakāya is called wisdom
3. In the form kāyas:
    3. 1 Manifestation in father aspect is method
    3. 2 Manifestation in mother aspect is wisdom
4. In the dharmakāya:
    4. 1 The wisdom realm free from reference points is wisdom
    4. 2 The great compassion wisdom aspect is method

Thus the Saṃpuṭa states:
"The nature free from elaboration
Is renowned as wisdom. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel,
Great compassion accomplishes all aims. ".

Likewise, in the realm free from reference points, wisdom and great compassion free from reference points become unified with mind, just as space is like space.

Thus, since the result is also Hevajra, this is the Hevajra Tantra. Such a tantra is a king because:

1. The causal tantra is a king because it naturally cannot be suppressed by conceptual thoughts
2. The method tantra is a king because it eliminates adventitious conceptual thoughts
3. The resultant tantra is a king because it cannot be suppressed by conceptual thoughts even temporarily

The meaning of the title "Glorious Saṃpuṭa Great Tantra" is also the same, for that tantra states: "Saṃpuṭa has the nature of method and wisdom." Thus it is similar to Hevajra. "Great" is similar to "king." Therefore, it should be understood according to the previous explanation as having the nature of the three tantras.

The meaning of the title "Noble Ḍākinī Vajra Tent King of Tantras":

1. "Noble" means far transcended from unwholesome, negative qualities
2. "Ḍākinī" refers to:
    2.1 The dharmakāya which, like space, is non-conceptual and equal to space
    2.2 The two form kāyas that magically pervade all buddha fields, thus "sky-going"
3. "Vajra" means emptiness, the nature of wisdom
4. "Tent" means network or connection - the interconnected wisdom that is the great compassion of the Tathāgatas, which is method

Thus, it is the non-dual method and wisdom - the result of perfect complete buddhahood. "Tantra" refers to the three tantras, as explained before.

Noble Ḍākinī is applied to method and resultant tantra. Regarding "examination" [brtag pa], as stated in the Vajraśekhara:

"Though all phenomena are formless,
Here they are shown in form.
Though all phenomena are beyond words,
Here they are shown in sound.
Therefore in these wondrous phenomena,
This is called examination through conception."

This applies from the form kāya of the buddhas up to the verbal tantra of expression. "King" is similar to before.

Thus, the tantra in terms of meaning to be expressed is mind itself - the non-dual wisdom that unifies method and wisdom, possessing the nature of the three tantras.

2. Regarding the verbal tantra that expresses this, there are two parts:
    2.1 The actual verbal tantra of expression
    2.2 The purpose and connection arising from that

2.1 Has two parts:
    2.1.1 That which is renowned through common [sources]
    2.1.2 That which is renowned through uncommon [sources]

2.1.1 Has three parts:
    2.1.1.1 Proper verbal expression
    2.1.1.2 Designated expression
    2.1.1.3 Dispelling objections to that

2.1.1.1 This is whatever appears as a mixture of verbal and meaning universals in one's cognition in the form of names, phrases and letters that teach the three tantras.

2.1.1.2 Designated expression refers to that which acts as a condition for generating this in the continuum, from the speech of buddhas up to the teacher's words and what is written in texts.

Regarding how this is designated: It is designated because it is the result of verbal continuum abiding in one's mind, and because it is the cause for generating verbal continuum in the minds of those who have not realized.

2.1.1.3 Regarding dispelling objections: If verbal tantra is also established from one's own cognition, [as stated] in the Abhidharma:

"The eighty thousand collections of Dharma
That were taught by the Sage..."

This would clash with what is explained in [the verse]:
"Those which were taught by the Sage
Are words or names, and these
Are included in form or formations."

Although there is a contradiction, such assertions are the tenets of the Vaibhāṣikas or Sautrāntikas. For us, conventionally we assert mere cognition.

If one objects that if the verbal and nominal aspects appearing to cognition are verbal tantra, then everything would become tantra - this is not so. Verbal and nominal aspects refer to mere expression, while tantra refers to that which teaches the three tantras as the meaning to be expressed.

If one objects that many conceptual or activity tantras that do not teach tantra would not be tantras, while the Pāramitās would become tantras since they teach tantra - this is partially true. Due to teaching tantra, there are texts called "Uttaratantra Śāstra." Many kriyā and caryā texts are designated names like "Raśmijāla Kalpa" or "Kriyāsamuccaya."

If one objects this contradicts the earlier division into four tantra classes:

These are mainly designated as method tantras like Kriyāsamuccaya, but since they ultimately teach the meaning of tantra, they are tantras.

2.1.2 The uncommon verbal tantra of authentic expression, as stated in the Vajraśekhara:

"For the benefit of all beings,
The buddhas enjoy the Dharma.
Awakened by the buddhas' compassion,
The meaning of tantra truly arose."

Thus, the authentic verbal tantra of expression is the Dharma enjoyment of bodhisattvas in Akaniṣṭha. What arises from that as designated verbal tantra includes what appears in the minds of current yogins up to what is in texts - these are designated verbal tantras. In any case...

The uncommon and common [verbal tantra], both actual and designated, constitute the collection of verbal tantras of expression.

2. The second general topic concerns the purpose and connection arising from that, which has four parts:
1. Subject matter
2. Purpose 
3. Ultimate purpose
4. Connection

2.1 First, the subject matter is the three tantras.

2.2 The purpose is for oneself and others to practice the three tantras.

2.3 The ultimate purpose is perfecting the three tantras.

If one asks: What is the difference between verbal tantra of expression and method tantra? What is the difference between ultimate purpose and resultant tantra?

The term "verbal expression" refers to the appearance of all three in general to one's cognition, while the three tantras themselves are the subject matter, and the actual achievement of the result is the ultimate purpose.

Alternatively, the non-dual unity of emptiness and compassion is the subject matter. The accomplishment of temporary results through practicing that is the purpose. The actualization of resultant tantra is the ultimate purpose.

The connection is that all are related as cause and result - method and what arises from method.

Thus, by explaining the four aspects of purpose and connection through the meaning of the tantra's title, this becomes suitable for explaining tantra and also serves as an instruction on how to explain tantra.

This primarily teaches the purpose and subject matter of tantra. This was the second chapter on the meaning of the tantra's title.

Now I will explain the third general topic - instructions on how to explain tantra. Although there are countless methods of explanation, the speech of the earlier masters consists of six [points]. In order to make it easy for listeners to understand and remember, there is the explanation through six instructions:

There are six instructions for explanation:

1. Explanation through the six instructions
2. Explanation through the three tantras, intended to establish one continuous mental continuum
3. Explanation through the three identities, to make empowerment into the path
4. Explanation through the four abodes, to make the four kāyas into the path
5. Explanation through the three purities, intended to abandon adverse factors to be eliminated
6. Explanation through seven secrets, to keep hidden meanings secret from unsuitable vessels

Regarding the first, the six instructions are taught in the Glorious Space-Like Tantra:

"Through letters and limbs,
Through condensed and general meaning,
Through hidden and ultimate meanings - 
These alone determine the tantras."

This comprises three instructions for explaining the meaning to be expressed and three instructions for explaining the expressing words.

The first three are:
1. Explanation through general meaning
2. Explanation through hidden meaning  
3. Explanation through ultimate meaning

The three verbal instructions are:
1. Explanation through branch meanings
2. Explanation through letter meanings
3. Explanation through essential instructions

The "general meaning" refers to what is common to both. This has two parts:
1. Common to the Pāramitā vehicle
2. Common to the generation stage

The first refers to what is common because the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, five paths, ten grounds etc. taught in the Pāramitā vehicle are also taught as objects of expression in secret mantra.

The general generation stage refers to what is common because the generation stage path is practiced both by those accomplishing supreme mahāmudrā and those accomplishing ordinary attainments.

The common generation stage is common because it is practiced by both those accomplishing supreme mahāmudrā and those accomplishing ordinary attainments, as it is common. As Ācārya Candrakīrti explained:

"Engaging in sūtras and such,
Dispelling regret,
And those endowed with generation stage -
These are explained as the general meaning. "

The "hidden meaning" refers to what is accessible to higher [practitioners] but not accessible to lower ones, hence "hidden. " Here, the higher ones are those who have obtained the three supreme empowerments, while the lower ones are those who have only obtained the vase empowerment. When named from the perspective of method, these are called:
1. Method of self-blessing
2. Method of maṇḍala wheel

When named from the perspective of bodhicitta:
1. Conventional bodhicitta
2. Ultimate bodhicitta

As stated in the Hevajra:
"Through the methods of maṇḍala wheel
And the stages of self-blessing,
Generate bodhicitta of both
Conventional and ultimate aspects. "

When named from the perspective of wisdom, these are called:
1. Self-arisen wisdom
2. Coemergent wisdom

In brief, all explanations focusing on the three secret dharma maṇḍalas are hidden meanings. Regarding the three maṇḍalas, both the Guhyasamāja and latter part of the Saṃpuṭa Tantra explain:

"The maṇḍala taught as the body,
The maṇḍala expressed as bhaga,
The maṇḍala as bodhicitta itself -
These three maṇḍalas should be understood. "

Of these:
1. The body maṇḍala teaches the nature of the coarse body and subtle channels
2. The bhaga maṇḍala teaches the nature of method-wisdom vajra-lotus and channel syllables
3. The bodhicitta maṇḍala teaches the nature of conventional bindus and the samādhi of bliss-emptiness born from the ultimate.

Along with these, the essential wisdom-winds that actualize them are also included within the hidden meaning. The ultimate refers to that which cannot be further enhanced, which is the wisdom of the buddhas. This has two aspects:
1. The general ultimate meaning, which is the eleventh bhūmi renowned in the common vehicles
2. The hidden ultimate meaning, which refers to the twelfth and thirteenth bhūmis renowned in secret mantra

If one objects that these two ultimates are not reasonable, arguing that if it is the general ultimate meaning, there can be no development of qualities beyond it, making a hidden ultimate impossible; and if qualities can be developed, it cannot be the general ultimate - [we respond that] qualities can indeed be developed. For instance:
1. The Pāramitā teachings do not explain the wisdom of dharmadhātu, while secret mantra does
2. The Pāramitā teachings do not explain the three kāyas, while secret mantra explains four or five kāyas
3. Similarly, the glorious Saṃpuṭa states: "Those who have not actualized the inconceivable state are the Sugatas, the buddhas. The actual Vajrasattva is taught as that which indicates the basis of characteristics. "

This shows a distinction, since the Pāramitā teachings say one cannot know appearances as other than other-appearing - they state that form is other and the wisdom of knowing all aspects is other. Secret mantra, however, teaches knowing everything as self-appearing. If one thinks it inappropriate to posit a general ultimate, it is appropriate because it accomplishes the proximate function. For example, the Abhisamayālaṃkāra states:

"Having transcended the nine bhūmis,
The wisdom by which one dwells in buddhahood,
That is the bodhisattva bhūmi. ".

This knows the tenth bhūmi to be [equivalent to buddhahood], which is similar to explaining the tenth bhūmi as the buddha level. If one thinks this contradicts Ācārya Candrakīrti's statement:

"Clear light is supremely shown,
And unity is realized - 
The ultimate is explained as twofold.
Ultimate means the final word,"

which explains emptiness and such as ultimate - there is no contradiction. For there are two systems regarding emptiness and unity:
1. Actually attaining their culmination
2. Teaching them as objects of general understanding

That which merely follows names as objects of general understanding is explained as the Pāramitā approach and general meaning.

The actual attainment of the ultimate is buddhahood itself:
1. Clear light refers to the dharmakāya
2. Unity refers to the saṃbhogakāya

When divided into topics to be explained, the three become six. The three expressions that explain these are:
1. Explanation through branch meanings
2. Explanation through letter meanings  
3. Explanation through essential instructions

First, regarding branch meanings - one enters into the actual meaning of the text through:
1. Words renowned in the world
2. Words renowned in treatises  
3. Words that definitively explain the reasons for verbal application

Regarding what is renowned in the world: For example, that which is established from the cause of fire-crystal, abides in space, and possesses hot light is renowned as "sun." In treatises, this same [sun] is renowned as:
1. The twelfth
2. The hundred-rayed one
3. Friend of lotuses
4. Light-maker
5. Day-maker and so forth

Regarding the reasons for verbal application: since the sun has twelve houses, opens lotuses, dispels darkness, conquers night, and possesses many such qualities, it is suitable to designate it as these various names. Such explanations are given through branch meanings.

Explanation through letter meanings refers to finding reasons through individual letters even when reasons cannot be found in the actual text. This has three aspects:
1. Explanation through sound association
2. Explanation through separated letters and sound association
3. Explanation through similar shapes

1. For example, when something like "naga hāśva" cannot be explained directly, through sound association:
- "na" means "nara" or person
- "ga" means "gavi" or cow

2. For example, when it is taught that "HŪṂ means free from grasping and grasped," the direct meaning of freedom from grasping and grasped cannot be explained, but when separated into letters and explained through sound:
- "ha grāhaka" leads to the object of grasping
- "ha grāhaca" leads to the grasping mind  
- Adding the suffix "śa" to the root "ū" becomes "śū", leading to "śūnyatā" or emptiness
- Without the crown sign it is "mano" or mind, thus indicating "mind-only empty of grasper and grasped"

3. Explanation through similar shapes is like when it is taught "evaṃ maya means navel, heart, throat and crown" - this cannot be explained directly, but through shapes, like how the triangular "e" corresponds in shape to the navel's transformation wheel.

Explanation through condensed essential instructions refers to that which is neither renowned in the world nor in treatises, nor can be explained through letters. Rather, it is symbolically indicated by the buddhas. For example, regarding alcohol [chang]:

In the world, it is known as "alcohol" [chang]. In treatises, it is known as "intoxicant. " Here, terms like "madana" are symbolic indicators of the Tathāgatas that are not objects of experience for ordinary beings. Similarly, for vegetables there are terms like "malindhanam," and for food terms like "tripita. " As Candrakīrti stated:

"Words like 'kotaksha' and such
Are found neither in the world nor treatises,
But are symbolic indicators of the Tathāgatas -
These are explained as non-literal. "

Thus, for each of the three topics of explanation or six when divided, there are three ways of verbal explanation. These are illustrated through examples and shown through the method of explaining tantras. First, regarding those like general Pāramitā practitioners, explanation through branch meanings is exemplified by statements like "First, meditate on loving-kindness":
- "First" refers to the sequence
- "Loving-kindness" refers to wishing for beings to meet with happiness and its causes
- "Meditate" means the yogin should contemplate in this way

These are words used according to their common meanings in both worldly usage and treatises. Regarding letter meanings: When it states "Established in teaching pretas," when Pāramitā practitioners wonder "How do they remain with pretas?":
- "Preta" comes from "pra" meaning "completely" and "eta" meaning "gone"
- Thus it means "remaining in complete freedom from conceptual thoughts"

Similarly, when wondering "What exactly is pāramitā?":
- "Pāra" means supreme, referring to buddhahood
- "Mitā" means going, thus meaning "going to the state of buddhahood"

Regarding explanation through essential instructions: When it states "Together with body of courage and atomic speech, from the nature of mind which is darkness," some might think "Oh, these mantra practitioners hold to the Sāṃkhya view," [this is explained through essential instructions].

The symbolic usage of "atomic dust," "darkness," and "heart-strength" indicates the three natures: imagined nature, dependent nature, and thoroughly established nature. Similarly, when it says "meditate on twelve arms," and one wonders "what are these twelve arms?" it means understanding the twelve links of dependent origination. In brief, when Pāramitā practitioners enter into Secret Mantra but don't understand the meaning of the two stages, to dispel their doubts thinking "Is this not the path?", some teachings are explained:
1. Literally
2. Through letters
3. Through symbols

This is taught to lead them in, and constitutes the general meaning of the Pāramitā path. As stated in the Jñānavajrasamuccaya: "For those who criticize after hearing the amazing vajra words, this explanation through non-contradictory approaches is the general meaning. "

Regarding explanation of the generation stage through branch meanings according to the general meaning: This refers to explanations according to the text, such as:

"From HŪṂ arises a vajra,
Black in color, greatly terrifying,
In the center of the vajra hub
Again meditate on the nature of HŪṂ. "

Regarding explanation through letter meanings:

For passages like "na and ga ha first, final śva and initial śva":
- "nara" means human flesh
- "gavi" means cow

Regarding explanation through essential instructions: For the statement "Gaurī holds the deer sign":
- "Gaurī" refers to Mahādeva's consort, symbolically indicating Vairocana in the form of a ḍākinī
- "Deer sign" refers to the moon, symbolically indicating the drop of bodhicitta.

Regarding explanation through branch meanings of the self-blessing concealment: This refers to explanations like "the navel chakra of emanation has sixty-four petals. "

Regarding explanation through letter meanings: The four evaṃ maya indicate the four chakras, explained through their corresponding shapes. Regarding explanation through essential instructions: Through symbolic language such as "Dharma, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya are body, speech, and mind," one is instructed to meditate on the four chakras and three channels. Regarding the branch meaning explanation of the maṇḍala wheel method: These are explanations directly understood from the text's words, such as "Embracing and kissing and so forth, various aspects are explained in various ways. "

Regarding explanation through letter meanings: Like showing the sky and secret [chakras] through their corresponding shapes using the symbolism of the two evaṃs. Regarding explanation through essential instructions: Like when it is explained "vajra intelligence" and stated "lotus kakola. "

Regarding the ultimate explanation through branch meanings: Like in the statement "The essence of body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas, the venerable one who is more secret than secrets. "

Regarding explanation through letter meanings: For the term "dwells" (bzhugs), "vi ja ha ra" where:
- "vi ci tra" means various
- "jana" means beings
- "hara" means capturing
meaning "capturing the minds of various beings to be tamed," like showing the nirmāṇakāya. Regarding the ultimate explanation through essential instructions: Like explaining the five wisdoms through the statement "Brahma, Viṣṇu, Śiva, and all are expressed as Buddha-nature. ".

Thus, when ultimately condensed into one, the five [levels] are combined with three each, making fifteen. When the ultimate [levels] are separated into two, the instructional methods become eighteen. What is taught in the tantra called Jñānavajrasamuccaya as "The Explanation of the Six Limits" refers to these very methods of explanation. How so? When explaining the general meaning's two [aspects] through branch meanings, this is called "literal explanation. " When explaining the general meaning's two [aspects] through letter meanings and essential instructions, this is called "non-literal explanation. " When explaining the hidden meaning through branch meanings, this is called "definitive explanation," while explaining the hidden meaning through letters and essential instructions is called "interpretive explanation. " When explaining the ultimate meaning through branch meanings, this is called "explanation without intention," while explaining through letters and essential instructions that becomes the ultimate meaning is called "explanation with intention. " 

Regarding how to explain tantras using these instructional methods, there are two approaches:
1. Applying the three types of meanings separately to the words and meanings of the text
2. Applying all three meanings to each individual word

The first approach emphasizes the branch meanings of the expressing words, while incorporating letters and essential instructions to a small degree according to context. In some sections of the text this explains the general meaning, in some the hidden meaning, and in some the ultimate meaning. Since this engages with the letters, names, and words of the text, it is called explanation through letter meanings, or direct textual explanation.

The first method is called "well-known explanation" because it accords with what is commonly known in both scriptures and treatises. Since it emphasizes branch meanings, it is called "explanation through branch meanings. "

The second approach explains each word in these ways:
1. For those of lesser understanding, to dispel doubts about inconsistency with the Pāramitā path, it explains in terms of the general Pāramitā teachings
2. For those who delight in rituals, it explains in terms of the general generation stage
3. For those devoted to the profound:
    3. 1 For those who delight in their own body
    3. 2 For those who delight in relying on a passionate consort
    It explains in terms of caṇḍālī and the method of the maṇḍala wheel
4. It explains the ultimate meaning:
    4. 1 For those without realization, to make it an object of general conceptual faith
    4. 2 For those with realization, to understand through samādhi as examples

Although there are many such explanatory methods, the Jñānavajrasamuccaya names four approaches:
1. Explanation through letter meanings
2. Explanation of general meaning
3. Explanation of hidden meaning
4. Explanation of ultimate meaning

In this lineage's tradition, the letter meaning explanation refers to the previous detailed exposition. The other four are named as explanations of:
1. General meaning
2. Self-blessing concealment
3. Maṇḍala wheel concealment
4. Ultimate meaning

Whatever the case, there is no contradiction in meaning. It should be understood that all highest yoga tantras follow this system of explanation. As some masters have stated:

"The four aspects are:
Outer, secret, and inner,
As well as suchness meaning—
Maṇḍala, karma mudrā,
Body, and natural abiding. "

This should be understood as consistent with these methods of explanation.

Here is the second section on methods of explanation:

With respect to explaining the tantras as three types based on the continuity of mind, the Guhyasamāja Uttaratantra states:

"Tantra means continuity,
And that continuity is threefold:
Basis, its nature, and 
That which is unshakeable.
Nature refers to cause,
Basis refers to method,
Likewise unshakeable is result—
These three summarize tantra's meaning."

This has two parts:
1. Explaining the methods of explanation 
2. How to explain tantras using these methods

1. The three types are:
1.1 Causal tantra
1.2 Method tantra  
1.3 Result tantra

Regarding causal tantra: This explains how all beings naturally possess the pure nirvāṇic nature, and when analyzed in detail, how the phenomena included within the aggregates, elements and sense bases—the thirty-five phenomena, or briefly the three of body, speech and mind—abide.

Regarding method tantra: This explains how to practice the ripening path of empowerment and the liberating path of the two stages—generation stage and completion stage—along with their auxiliaries.

Regarding result tantra: This explains how, having ripened the cause through empowerment and practiced generation and completion stages accordingly, one gives rise to realized samādhi in one's mindstream, attains the level of accomplishment, and directly manifests the buddha bodies and pristine wisdom exactly as they are.

Since these topics can be understood in detail from the Abhisamaya of the Tantra, they are not elaborated here.

2. As for how to explain tantras using these methods:

2. As for how to explain tantras using these methods, there are two parts like before:
1. Some explain causal tantra in some places, method tantra in some places, ripening path in some places, liberation path in some places, and result tantra in some places. 2. Others explain multicolored (mixed) meanings and explain each word as possessing the three tantras. In this way, the six instructions explain the meaning of the text and letters. By relating the three tantras to the manifest realization of experiential meaning, these two become the principal methods of explanation. The third method of explanation, explaining through the three essences for the sake of empowerment and path, is taught in the Ākāśasamatantra:

"Through the three types of union—
Mantra, form and dharma essence—
One remains unstained by saṃsāra's faults
And enters the meaning of tantra. "

This has two parts:
1. Explaining what the three essences are
2. How to explain tantra using them

1. First:
- Generation stage showing the body itself as nirmāṇakāya after receiving vase empowerment to the body is the form essence
- Caṇḍālī mantra essence showing speech itself as saṃbhogakāya after receiving secret empowerment to speech
- Dharma essence showing mind itself as dharmakāya after receiving wisdom-knowledge empowerment to mind 
- Ultimate dharma essence showing wind-mind as svabhāvikakāya after receiving fourth empowerment to body, speech and mind together with winds

Thus when combining both dharma essence and ultimate dharma essence as one, there are three essences. When distinguished separately:
- "To the body" refers to the basis or causal tantra
- "Vase empowerment" refers to the ripening path
- "Generation stage" refers to the liberation path.

The nirmāṇakāya refers to the result. Since all four of these are external phenomena, they are designated by the name "form essence. " The lower three should also be understood accordingly. 2. As for how to explain tantra using these, there are two approaches:
1. Explaining tantra as wrathful, where in some places form body is explained, in some places form ripening path, in some places form liberation path, in some places form result, in some places mantra basis of speech, and in some places results like saṃbhogakāya and so forth. 2. The second approach explains each word in terms of mantra, form and dharma, and each of these is explained in terms of cause, empowerment, path and result, making twelve explanations. Or by dividing dharma into two, there are sixteen explanations. This method of explanation is very extensive and is similar to combining the previous six instructions with the explanations of the three tantras into one approach. The fourth method of explanation explains the four abodes for the sake of making the four kāyas into the path. As taught in the Glorious Ākāśasama:

"With mass and water and with form,
Likewise transcending form—
In these four abodes
The tantras are definitively established. "

This has two parts:
1. Explaining what this method is
2. How to explain tantra using it

1. First:
- The saṃbhogakāya abides as mass because it experiences bliss
- The dharmakāya abides as water, being of one taste like water mixed with water, or like a drop of water free from conceptual elaboration
- The nirmāṇakāya abides as form since it has faces and arms
- The svabhāvikakāya abides as transcending form since everything dissolves into it.

Just as there are four abodes for the resultant four kāyas, there are four abodes for the causal tantra as the basis for purification, explained in terms of womb-born beings:

1. When parents experience bliss during union, the intermediate state being is attracted to that bliss and enters the womb. Thus experiencing bliss corresponds to saṃbhogakāya, abiding as mass.

2. The intermediate consciousness faints within the semen and blood, abiding like the mer mer po and so forth, which corresponds to abiding as water.

3. The stage when the sense faculties are complete and the body is established corresponds to abiding as form.

4. The stage of death corresponds to abiding as transcending form.

Since both cause and result have these four abodes, the four empowerments and four paths should be applied accordingly.

Each path also has four abodes. For example:
- The causal Vajradhara with consort abides as mass
- The causal Vajradhara melting into light abides as water  
- From arising as the deity through receiving empowerment abides as form
- The dissolution of the deity abides as transcending form

Or similarly, countless applications can be made as taught in the second chapter of the fifth section of the Saṃpuṭa Tantra.

2. As for how to explain tantra using these methods:
Like before, the mixed application explains causal abiding in some places, resultant in some places, and path in some places. Although there is no application of all four abodes to each word, each word is explained in terms of cause, path and result, applied to all three tantras. This is similar to the explanation of the three tantras.

The fifth method of explanation concerns abandoning discordant factors through the three purities, as taught in the ninth chapter of the Hevajra:

"All phenomena are definitely
Proclaimed as pure suchness.
Then through individual divisions,
The deities should be proclaimed.
Self-aware nature's purity—
Not liberation through other purities."

This has two parts:
1. What are the methods of explanation
2. How to explain tantra using them

1. First, there are three purities:
1. Purity of suchness
2. Purity of individual deities 
3. Purity of self-awareness

These three are each included within:
1. Three purities subsumed under causal tantra
2. Three purities subsumed under method tantra  
3. Three purities subsumed under resultant tantra

For the three of causal tantra:
1. The primordially unborn suchness of all phenomena is the purity of suchness
2. The appearance as deities with faces and arms is the purity of individual deities
3. All appearances being established as one's own mind is the purity of self-awareness

For the three purities of method tantra:
1. The view that cuts through conceptual elaborations through hearing and contemplation is the purity of suchness
2. The generation stage is the purity of individual deities
3. The completion stage is the purity of self-awareness

One should understand that empowerments and beyond can also be applied in terms of these three purities.

For the three purities of resultant tantra:
1. The svabhāvikakāya is the purity of suchness
2. The two form kāyas are the purity of individual deities
3. The dharmakāya is the purity of self-awareness

2. As for how to explain tantra using these methods:
Applying them separately to the three tantras is the multicolored explanation. Although one cannot apply all three purities to each word, explaining each word in terms of cause, method and result is the complete method of explanation. This should be understood as similar to the explanation of the three tantras.

The sixth method of explanation is explained in terms of seven secrets:

The sixth method of explanation is explained in terms of seven secrets, as taught in the latter part of the Glorious Saṃpuṭa Tantra:

"Secret is the unclear.
Secret is the brief teaching of suchness.
Secret is the five seeds.
Secret is the hidden supreme object.
Secret is the secret lotus.
Secret is the navel bliss.
Secret is the gathering of what goes everywhere.
Secret is boundless bliss - this is the explanation of the tantra's text."

Thus eight are taught. This has two parts:
1. What are these methods
2. How to explain tantra using them

1. First: Although eight secrets are taught in the tantra, how are there seven secrets? As taught in that same text: "The term 'secret' refers to seven, while the eighth has the characteristic of being inexpressible." The two terms "boundless bliss" and "unclear secret" are considered one among the seven because the unclear refers to the meaning to be realized, the causal tantra, while boundless bliss shows the realization of that, making these two identical in terms of basic nature. The eighth, being inexpressible, refers to the fact that the realization of basic nature itself cannot be shown, so this is excluded.

The brief teaching of suchness refers to the ripening path of empowerment.
The five seeds refer to the generation stage.
The hidden supreme object refers to the view of realization.
The secret lotus refers to the methods of the maṇḍala wheel.
The navel bliss refers to self-blessing.
The gathering of what goes everywhere teaches the branches of the path.

2. As for how to explain tantra using this method, unlike the previous methods of explanation which applied many interpretations to each word,

Here these methods do not apply many interpretations to each word. Rather, the meaning of the text itself connects to various contexts in a variegated explanation, similar to the manifest realization. This method of explanation is also similar to what some masters call "The Explanation of Tantra's Meaning Through Five Branches":

The five branches are:
1. The preliminary branch of empowerment
2. The branch of manifest realization of the path, comprising the two stages
3. The branch of commitments and vows as companions of the path
4. The branch of conduct that provides stability
5. The branch of the collection of activities as results:
    5. 1 Common results: 
        - Lesser: pacification and so forth
        - Middling: great accomplishments
    5. 2 Supreme result: Buddhahood

Similarly, the latter part of the Guhyasamāja Tantra explains this through four or five branches:
1. Approaching (bsnyen pa)
2. Accomplishing (sgrub pa)
3. Near-accomplishing (nye bar sgrub pa)
4. Great accomplishment (sgrub pa chen po)
5. The common branch of all these

Likewise, the Cakrasaṃvara explains this concisely in terms of:
1. The secret of the path
2. The secret of the result
3. The branch that perfects these

In brief, there are three methods for explaining tantras:
1. Applying condensed meaning to each word
2. Applying multiple meanings to words
3. Applying single meanings to each word

The extensive applications can be done in any way, corresponding to the earlier methods. The single applications can be done in any way, corresponding to the seven secrets. Moreover, manifest realization implicitly transforms into the three tantras, while word meanings are primarily explained through the meaning of the branches. Now I will explain how to dispel objections to these methods of explanation.

There are three points regarding this:
1. Abandoning many ineffective methods of explanation
2. Abandoning the fault of explaining to a gathering what should be explained singularly
3. Abandoning the fault of many methods becoming others' ways of explanation

Regarding the first: If one objects that applying many explanations to each word is meaningless since such extensive explanations are not seen nowadays,

This is true - applying many explanations to every word is not seen nowadays. Since these are degenerate times, beings have weak intelligence and diligence and are thus incapable. However, by understanding these methods of explanation and having explanations for the introductory sections and some difficult points in the concise teachings, one generates understanding of the whole, using one aspect to indicate all.

If one objects that since these individual methods of explanation are merely entering into the meaning of the words, this would become an explanation to a gathering, as stated by Ācārya Candrakīrti:
"Literal meaning, non-intended meaning,
Provisional meaning, and whatever is
The meaning of words and general meaning -
These are taught to be explained to gatherings.
Non-literal meaning, definitive meaning,
Likewise intended explanation itself,
Hidden and ultimate meanings -
These are taught to be explained to students."

This is incorrect. Neither would completely explain the tantra to both [audiences], and even if both were taught to students, the tantra could not be completely explained to gatherings. As stated in Candrakīrti's commentary: "Since we see that in some cases only intended explanation and so forth are taught individually, this position is untenable. Therefore it is not so."

2. Regarding which are the two methods of explanation: Explaining all tantras through the three instructions on methods of explanation of the general meaning in two parts is for teaching to gatherings. The complete explanation is given to students who have become teachers and possess intelligence for profound and vast [teachings]. 

This explanation in terms of word meanings, since it explains the hidden and ultimate [meanings], is for students. And since the general meaning also includes all that was taught in condensed form, it is for students of weak intelligence who aspire to accomplishment.

3. Regarding abandoning the third objection: Here, some say: "Although many instructional methods of explanation are applied, the Vajrajñānasamuccaya Tantra teaches what are called the 'Seven Ornaments':

2. Regarding which are the two methods of explanation: Explaining all tantras through the three instructions on methods of explanation of the general meaning in two parts is for teaching to gatherings. The complete explanation is given to students who have become teachers and possess intelligence for profound and vast [teachings].

This explanation in terms of word meanings, since it explains the hidden and ultimate [meanings], is for students. And since the general meaning also includes all that was taught in condensed form, it is for students of weak intelligence who aspire to accomplishment.

3. Regarding abandoning the third objection: Here, some foolish ones say: "Although the 'Seven Ornaments' are taught - the five introductory topics, the four reasonings, the six limits, the four methods, the two explanations, the examination of students, and the two truths - these are incomplete here. Moreover, these explanations in terms of general and hidden meanings follow the Vajrajñānasamuccaya Tantra and are the system of Ārya Nāgārjuna and his spiritual sons. Since these are not in the Hevajra Tantra, they are concealed here." These foolish ones, content with merely their own tradition and disparaging others, are like long-lived gods without consciousness.

Regarding this, since our teachers do not speak of these "Seven Ornaments," we need not discuss them. However, they are all complete here. How so? The Seven Ornaments are:

1. Five introductory topics: name, cause, author, measure, and purpose
2. Four reasonings: tantra, background story, definitive words, and cause
3. These two can be understood through the sections on the divisions of tantra classes, their origins, and the meaning of their names
4. The six limits, four methods, and two ways of explanation are taught through the instructions on methods of explaining tantras
5. The examination of students and two truths can be understood through manifest realization of the tantra

All these should be understood as included within this method of explanation.

Moreover, regarding their statement that "this explanation conceals others' explanations," we should ask: Does "concealing" refer to seeing something good in others' traditions that is not in one's own tradition and thus concealing it? Or does it refer to calling something "concealed" when other tantras clarify names not found in this tantra?

Regarding the first, if they say it conceals because they saw something good: Our system speaks of "six instructions," which are equal to space - how could this be equivalent to their "four methods and six limits" from the Ārya cycle? If they say the meanings are equivalent, that is excellent - one should understand that this method correctly explains the Buddha's intent without error.

Furthermore, even if one reconciles the six limits, four methods, and six instructions, when we have many other instructional methods of explanation such as the three identities and four abodes, which tradition's methods are being concealed here? Therefore, our tradition's limitless methods of explanation are known from an unbroken lineage of accomplished gurus - how could others realize such methods? One who realizes such methods is like the Elder Śrī Dharmapāla, the lord of yogins known as Vīrapa, who became a completely accomplished paṇḍita.

After becoming a completely accomplished paṇḍita, he made practice his essence. Having directly received empowerment from the wisdom ḍākinī and attaining the level of great accomplishment, he actualized mahāmudrā in that very body. He became accomplished in such a way that neither outsiders nor insiders could criticize him even slightly. Even today, he is praised by all as "Lord of Power."

Similarly, there was one known as the lord of yogins Ḍombī Śrī Heruka, who was also renowned as a disciple of Virūpa. Having received empowerment from the wisdom ḍākinī, he engaged in Samantabhadra's conduct in the land called Raḍa. In that very body, he transformed into the form of Bhagavān Glorious Heruka possessing the eight powers, and became a master unanimously acknowledged by all worldly beings. Having perfectly comprehended the meaning of the tantra just as it is, this could be known through his unbroken lineage.

Thus, their lineage proceeded through: Virūpa's disciple Kṛṣṇa, his disciple Ḍamapa, his disciple Avadhūtipa, his disciple Gayadhara, and also Ḍombi's disciple Lalala Vajra.

His disciple was Nags khrod pa, his disciple was Garbhari, his disciple was Jayaśrī Śāntipa, his disciple was Ajitacandra, his disciple was Vīravajra. The great Tibetan translator 'Brog mi Śākya ye shes was a disciple of both Gayadhara and Vīravajra. He illuminated all the regions of the Land of Snows, and even today, since explanations are given based on all the Hevajra tantras translated by this great translator, he is like a compiler of the tantras. As for the disciples of this great translator:

The great translator had these disciples:

Supreme Heart and Supreme King,
Supreme Knowledge and Supreme Vision. From Supreme Heart and Supreme Knowledge Masters,
The lineage passed to two masters of Supreme Radiance. Just as four river streams flow from Lake Anavatapta, and those streams divide and merge again before flowing into the great ocean, similarly [these lineages] merged into our master, the great ocean of Dharma. If someone objects that "since [these teachings] exist within the tantra itself, it is not appropriate to clarify them here," then by that logic, merely reading the tantra would suffice and no explanations whatsoever would be necessary. If one claims to explain through the guru's instructions alone, who can explain any secret mantra without oral instructions? It is excellent when those instructions are illuminated by scriptural authority. If one relies solely on oral instructions without scripture, it will lead to many fabricated statements by those who make things up. Therefore, as it is said "The tantra should be understood from the tantra. " Also, from the commentary on Vajrahṛdaya: "One will understand the words of Hevajra, Cakrasaṃvara, and Catuḥpīṭha. Likewise, through the words of the Concise Cakrasaṃvara, [one understands] Catuḥpīṭha and Hevajra," and so forth. However, this does not mean combining all tantras indiscriminately. Rather, it means that through the guru's instructions, certain understanding of the root tantra should be gained from the tantra itself. Therefore, most other explanations of tantras are merely one-sided explanations, either based on the paṇḍitas' grammatical analysis or explaining the tantra as merely a method of practice based on knowing only the oral instructions for practice.

This explanation of tantra is like a wish-fulfilling jewel that reveals the methods of all secret mantras.

This was the third chapter teaching the instructions on methods for explaining tantras from "The General Presentation of Tantra Classes."

The General Presentation of Tantra Classes is:
- The Eye of Yoga
- A Treasury of Precious Scripture that Vastly Develops Intelligence
- A Lamp Illuminating the Profound Sūtras and Tantras
- A Mirror for Viewing the Boundless Intent of the Victorious Ones

I wrote this based on the guru's words.
What is written here is not composed arbitrarily,
But seen in sūtras, tantras and treatises that clarify them,
And analyzed with understanding.

Therefore, glorious gurus and assembly of ḍākinīs,
Be pleased with this well-spoken work,
And until I attain the three kāyas,
Out of love for me, pacify obstacles on the path.

Through the virtue of writing this,
May all beings complete the accumulations of merit and wisdom,
And attain the state of Vajradhara,
At the peak of the glorious ten bhūmis.

Here concludes "The General Presentation of Tantra Classes: An Introduction to All Tantras." May countless beings understand this and attain supreme vast intelligence.

This was composed by the yogin Sonam Tsemo.

The meaning of this was fully completed at the edge of the snow mountains, like the cool rays of a perfect lamp falling, completely clear and undisturbed, by the great master who attained the siddhi of retaining what is heard, whose mind was well-trained like refined gold, possessing all supreme qualities, who directly realized the level free from doubt regarding objects of knowledge, whose brilliant wisdom shines like dawn

The great being, who possessed qualities worthy of veneration, having vanquished the enemy forces of the darkness of ignorance, who perfectly completed all accumulations of merit and wisdom, who became an object of worship crowned by the jewel pinnacle of the world including gods, the great scholar who was an ornament of the world, having attained the siddhi of knowledge-holder and directly proceeded to Sukhāvatī - from his composition, due to the difficult power of its poetic meter and arrangement of words, when it became hard for beginners to retain in mind, by the command of the great venerable one who is inseparable from the Sugata, and urged by some noble friends, later at the sacred hermitage of Sakya itself, I, Kunga Gyaltsen, who was born there, who has wisdom engaged in learning, a youth of the Khön lineage free from harm, borrowed and made it easy to comprehend. Like seeing the signs of the supreme lord of ḍākinīs
Gliding in the sky to the right,
The honey-holder with lotus limbs
Also strove to follow after. Thus it should be understood. The woodblock was printed by Guru.

# Tibetan Text Translation

From Volume One of the Collected Works [gsung rab glegs bam] of Master Ratnakīrti [rin po che bsod nams rtse mo], who was renowned as a Great Paṇḍita of the Five Sciences, this is "A General Presentation of the Classes of Tantra."

Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ!

I bow respectfully with my crown to the feet of the holy venerable guru Bhaṭṭāraka.
I bow to glorious Vajrasattva.

Oṃ svasti siddhaṃ!

I bow respectfully with my crown to the feet of the holy venerable master.
I bow to glorious Vajrasattva.

This is bound with the prasthāra obtained from verse 2,438 among the 16,384 verses of the powerful fourteen-fold meter of equal composition, realized through wondrous understanding.

Lord of all, protector of beings, glorious chief Vajradhara,
Who assumed an ordinary form to train those of lesser minds,
According to their fortune, ripening them through limitless body, speech and mind—
I bow with joined palms at my crown to the guru's feet.

Through whose compassion, in wrathful form,
With the radiance of a hundred thousand suns illuminating non-dual meaning,
By merely saying "HŪṂ" dispels all obstacles—
I pray for protection from the steadfast hero wielding the vajra.

The distinctions of tantras to be attained and means of attainment
Following the Dharma in accord with the guru's words,
Delighting those who enjoy elaboration,
Are clearly explained elsewhere through understanding of scripture's meaning.

Here, for those who seek understanding with minimal elaboration...

Here, for those who seek understanding with minimal elaboration,
Following with faith the guru's words alone,
Taking scripture as chief for its meaning's sake—
I shall write a brief presentation of the classes of tantra.

Though already clarified well by the learned ones,
To increase understanding in self and others and familiarize with excellent explanations,
Like when fledgling birds still learning to fly
Train even before their wings are fully developed,

Since most beings endowed with understanding will engage after knowing the distinctions between the object to be focused upon, the result to be attained, and the path that accomplishes attainment,

It is appropriate to first present this general exposition at the beginning of the classes of tantra. Then, to demonstrate how this path is superior to others, the meaning of the tantras' names follows. To help those of lesser intellect easily understand such a superior path, after that come the oral instructions on methods for explaining tantra. Then, having properly understood the meaning of tantra, to show how it develops in the mindstream when put into practice, the manifest realization of tantra follows thereafter.

These four approaches should be understood as: the entrance way traveled by the wise from the writings of the great master of yoga Virūpa; the lamp illuminating all tantras; the stairway to the city of nirvāṇa difficult to understand for those lacking merit; and that which possesses all supreme aspects.

Regarding the first, the general presentation has two parts:

The first general presentation has two parts:

1. The presentation of the object of focus or result to be attained
2. The presentation of the path that accomplishes attainment along with its divisions

Regarding the first, in general, the ultimate object of focus or result to be attained is solely the single result called "the state of unsurpassed perfect and complete buddhahood. " This has two parts:

1. Explaining the characteristics
2. Establishing it as singular

Regarding the first, what are the characteristics of buddhahood? They are three:
1. Understanding the nature of reality without error
2. Possessing perfect uncontaminated bliss 
3. Being free from all obscuring stains

That this is so can be known from scripture:
"I am Buddha due to understanding things. "
"Completely awakened due to understanding bliss. "
"Buddhahood is freedom from obscurations like Brahma. "

Among these three, first, "being free from obscurations" is the cause. The obscurations are three:
1. Afflictive obscurations like anger that obstruct omniscience of all phenomena
2. Cognitive obscurations that obstruct understanding things as they are
3. Meditative absorption obscurations

These three comprise all obscurations. "Freedom" means complete freedom. Thus there is perfect abandonment, like awakening from sleep - this is the meaning of "Buddha. " Through attaining such a state, one understands both conventional phenomena and their ultimate nature. This is the dharmakāya of inseparable basic space and primordial wisdom, realized through understanding profound dependent origination.

Through attaining such a state, what is called "understanding bliss" refers to possessing immeasurable buddha qualities such as enlightened form, primordial wisdom and so forth - this is called the bliss of complete liberation. Thus these two, like a fully bloomed lotus with mind opened and expanded, constitute the meaning of the term "Buddha. " This is perfect primordial wisdom. In this way, each of these three individually implies all other qualities indirectly. Although many characteristics of buddhahood are taught in numerous sūtras, tantras, treatises and commentaries, here only these three are explained. This is based solely on what the holy guru taught from the Second Investigation and the Saṃpuṭa Tantra. Through this, one should understand that all characteristics and qualities of buddhahood are included. Regarding the second point of establishing the ultimate result as singular, there are two parts:
1. The reasoning establishing it as singular
2. Dispelling objections to that

Regarding the first, although there are many divergent paths in general, there is only one ultimate destination. As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:
"Because through many dharmas,
Like rivers flowing to the ocean,
Liberation itself is singular—
Many goals are not conceived. "

And from the Uttaratantra, using the metaphor of rivers and ocean as examples for both sides, it states: "For example, when many rivers flow into the great ocean, there is no opportunity for them to appear separately. " This establishes that although there are many philosophical systems, there is only one nature of reality, and although there are many paths, there is only one ultimate destination. Furthermore, since the ultimate result is understanding the nature of reality, and since the nature of reality is not multiple, the ultimate is also not multiple.

Moreover, "being singular" means being of one kind in terms of perfect abandonment and primordial wisdom, not like merging into the Self as taught by non-Buddhist philosophers where things become one in essence. 2. Dispelling objections to that has two parts:
1. Dispelling the fault of there being multiple philosophical systems
2. Dispelling the fault regarding the teaching of three vehicles

Regarding the first: If one thinks there must be multiple natures of reality since multiple philosophical systems appear, like the Self taught by non-Buddhists and so forth, [this is incorrect]. The appearance of multiplicity is merely conceptually imputed by those who have not realized the ultimate. For those who have realized, there is nothing whatsoever apart from profound dependent origination. For example, although various rivers appear outside the ocean, they become one taste when merging with it. Or like how a single sun disk appears differently due to different locations. Or like how a hundred blind men touching an elephant each experience different sensations. 2. Regarding dispelling the fault of teaching three vehicles: One might wonder, "How should we interpret the Blessed One's teaching of three types of enlightenment corresponding to the three types of beings?"

That was taught temporarily as a provisional path result in order to lead those of lesser capacity. This establishes the single vehicle doctrine and is called the view of realization. Since generating bodhicitta is the beginning of the path, this is taught first to make it clear. All treatises that establish the meaning of reality, like the Madhyamaka treatises and so forth, clarify this meaning.

These can be understood in detail in those [texts]. From the General Presentation of Tantra Classes, this is the first chapter establishing the ultimate fruition that is the object to be focused on at the start of all paths. The presentation of the path for attaining that has five parts:
1. The essential nature of the path
2. The divisions of that path
3. The characteristics of each division
4. How the Vajrayāna vehicle is superior to the Pāramitāyāna
5. Specific analysis of the Vajrayāna vehicle

The first has two parts:
1. The definition of the path
2. Its divisions

First, [the definition]: It is the means for attaining one's respective objects of focus. The divisions are two:
1. Common paths
2. Uncommon paths

The first has three:
1. Paths that lead to lower realms
2. Paths that merely attain higher realms
3. Paths that merely attain liberation

1. The first refers to some inferior non-Buddhist philosophers who hold nihilistic views and so forth. 2. Those that merely attain higher realms are the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers like the Jainas and others. 3. Those that merely attain liberation are the paths of the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. The second general topic regarding the uncommon path has two parts:
1. The purpose of teaching the common path
2. The characteristics of the unique Mahāyāna

Regarding the first: If one wonders "Why teach the common path when the uncommon path alone would suffice?", there are three purposes:
1. To guide various types of beings by those following the Mahāyāna
2. To remove doubts about the path by understanding what accords and does not accord with it
3. To refute those who claim to practice the Mahāyāna without having developed even the common path.

First, regarding the divisions of beings' spiritual dispositions, the Uttaratantra states there are three types:
1. Those who desire existence
2. Those who desire freedom from existence
3. Those who desire neither of these

The meaning of this is:
1. Those who desire existence are some inferior non-Buddhist philosophers
2. Those who desire peace are of two types:
   2.1. Those unskilled in methods
   2.2. Those skilled in methods
The unskilled in methods are the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers, while the skilled are the Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas.
3. The third type, those who view existence and peace equally, are the bodhisattvas. As stated in the Bodhicaryāvatāra:
"Free from the extremes of attachment and destruction,
They remain accomplished while dwelling in saṃsāra."

Thus, after teaching their respective paths to these three types, they are ultimately led to the Mahāyāna. With this intention it was stated: "There is nothing that a bodhisattva should not learn."

2. Removing doubts about the path by understanding what accords and does not accord with it means: By understanding all paths, one discerns the distinctions between phenomena and, realizing one's own path as supreme, abandons attention to other paths.

3. Refuting those who claim to practice the Mahāyāna without having developed even the common path means: Some individuals who haven't even developed the mindset of supreme non-Buddhist philosophers arrogantly claim "I am a Mahāyāna practitioner." For them, there is the purpose of understanding the meaning of Mahāyāna by recognizing "This path is mine, that path belongs to others." Therefore, the common path must be taught.

The second part regarding the characteristics of the unique Mahāyāna has three parts:

1. First, regarding the nature of the unique path: It is the means of the Mahāyāna for attaining the result of omniscience. 2. There are four ways in which it is superior to the common paths:
   2. 1. Superior through engaging in methods to eliminate suffering
   2. 2. Superior through having no attachment to saṃsāra
   2. 3. Superior through entering the Buddha vehicle as the method for liberation
   2. 4. Superior through entering the Mahāyāna which teaches the inseparability of emptiness and compassion as the path of equality between existence and peace, not merely desiring liberation

2. 1. Regarding engaging in methods to eliminate suffering, there are two:
   2. 1. 1. Eliminating suffering of this life
   2. 1. 2. Eliminating suffering of future lives

2. 1. 1. The first refers to engaging in what is taught in treatises on proper conduct and so forth. Through this, one is superior to the ignorant like cowherds who have not entered any philosophical system. 2. 1. 2. Eliminating suffering of future lives means developing the path to higher realms in one's mindstream through confidence in karma and its results. Through this, one is superior to those with wrong views like the nihilists and others who hold inferior philosophical systems. 2. 2. Second, having no attachment to saṃsāra means thinking: "Alas! Although I wish to eliminate suffering, if I do not abandon this saṃsāra, I will not be freed from suffering. Therefore, I must attain liberation. " This is the mindset of abandoning all worldly paths. While the supreme non-Buddhist philosophers may also have some semblance of such a mindset, they have still not entered the actual methods for liberation.

2. 3. Regarding entering the Buddha vehicle as the method for liberation, there are two parts:
1. Taking refuge in the Three Jewels
2. Accepting the four seals of the Buddha's teaching

1. First, by taking refuge in the Buddha, one abandons worldly teachers like Īśvara and others, and abandons aspiring to their attainments. By taking refuge in the Dharma, one abandons worldly paths that harm sentient beings along with their basis. By taking refuge in the Saṅgha, one abandons association with non-Buddhist practitioners. Moreover, by taking refuge itself, one accepts the four seals of the Buddha's teaching:
1. All conditioned phenomena are impermanent
2. All contaminated phenomena are suffering
3. All transcendence of suffering is peace and bliss
4. All phenomena are selfless

If one takes refuge in the Three Jewels but does not accept the four seals, one is still considered a Buddhist, like the Śrāvaka Sthiramati. If some claim "The Blessed One stated that such a person is not a Buddhist," then by that logic, since it is stated "Those who do not assert all phenomena as lacking inherent existence are not my disciples," even the Cittamātrins and others would not be Buddhists. Through these [qualities], one is distinguished from all non-Buddhist philosophers. 2. 4. "Entering specifically into the Mahāyāna itself" means: Through engaging in abandoning suffering in the way previously explained, one is distinguished from those who have not entered any philosophical system. Through holding the Three Jewels, one is distinguished from non-Buddhists.

Through engaging in the equality of existence and peace, one is distinguished from Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. If one asks how this is superior to the Śrāvakas, there are three points:
1. Distinctions between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of scriptures or philosophical tenets
2. Distinctions between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of path and result
3. The rationale for establishing these separate distinctions regarding scriptures and path-result

1. First, the twelve branches of scripture and seven Abhidharma treatises and so forth that are well-known among the Śrāvakas who hold philosophical tenets and have pride in their Abhidharma are called the Śrāvaka scriptures. The vast scriptures unknown to them, such as the Prajñāpāramitā and extensive Vaipulya sūtras, are called the Mahāyāna scriptures. Although there are infinite detailed distinctions between these two, 

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states:
"Five dharmas and three natures,
Eight types of consciousness,
And the two types of selflessness—
All of Mahāyāna is contained within these. "

The five dharmas are:
1. Names
2. Reasons
3. Conceptualization 
4. Suchness
5. Perfect wisdom

The three natures are:
1. The imagined
2. The dependent
3. The perfect

The eight consciousnesses are:
1. The six collections beginning with eye consciousness
2. The afflicted mind
3. The foundational consciousness

The two types of selflessness are:
1. Selflessness of persons
2. Selflessness of phenomena

These teachings are the Mahāyāna texts. Other masters like Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga have taught many other distinctions that should be investigated elsewhere.

2. Regarding the distinction between greater and lesser vehicles in terms of path and result, the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra states:

"Because it possesses seven greatnesses:
1. Greatness of focus
2. Likewise two accomplishments
3. Wisdom and diligence in undertaking
4. Skillful means
5. Great perfect accomplishment
6. Great enlightened activity of buddhas
Therefore it is definitively called the Great Vehicle."

Among these, the first five are paths, being that by which one travels. The latter two are results, being where one arrives - the great purpose for oneself and others. Although many different ways of establishing these distinctions have been taught, know that they are all included within these. These also are included within the two: great compassion and great wisdom. Therefore, the Great Vehicle is ultimate in terms of both scriptures and path-result.

3. If one thinks: "Wouldn't it be sufficient to show the distinction between these two through either scriptures or philosophical tenets alone? Why are path and result needed? Or conversely, wouldn't explaining path and result be sufficient?" This is not so.

The distinctions of scriptures and philosophical tenets were made to refute the Śrāvaka schools who claim that their own extensive collections alone are the Mahāyāna and that other texts like the Prajñāpāramitā were not spoken by the Buddha. Therefore, this also relates to establishing the Mahāyāna as Buddha's word. Furthermore, the distinctions of path and result were taught to dispel the wrong view of some Mahāyānists who think that once one enters these scriptures, one will definitely not become a Śrāvaka or Pratyekabuddha. Although they hold Mahāyāna philosophical tenets

Since they hold Mahāyāna philosophical tenets but do not possess the seven great qualities, they will become Śrāvakas. 3. Regarding the third general point about special distinctions, there are four divisions:
1. Those who assert three results from three paths
2. Those who assert three results from one path  
3. Those who assert one result from one path
4. Those who assert one result from three paths

The first position is held by Ācārya Asaṅga and others, who maintain that through the Śrāvaka scriptures one attains the state of an Arhat or Pratyekabuddha, while through Mahāyāna scriptures one attains buddhahood. They teach that even within the Mahāyāna, paths for all three types of spiritual dispositions are taught, since it is explained that if one strays from the path, one will become a Śrāvaka or Pratyekabuddha. The second position is held by Ācārya Candrakīrti, who maintains that through Śrāvaka philosophical tenets one cannot even attain arhatship. Although all three types are liberated through Mahāyāna philosophical tenets, he considers the Śrāvaka philosophical tenets to be merely provisional meaning within the Mahāyāna. The third position is held by some who maintain that by relying on the Mahāyāna path, one temporarily accomplishes one result and ultimately attains enlightenment. The fourth position is held by some masters following the White Lotus Sutra and other teachings. Using the example of the householder, they explain that temporarily one is established on three paths but ultimately attains enlightenment. As stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra:

"Having attained the body of samādhi,
One does not attain enlightenment for an eon. Like a drunken person
Who becomes sober when the intoxication wears off,
Similarly, they attain what is called
My buddha-body and dharma. "

Since this approach and the position asserting one result from one path are essentially the same, I too find this position acceptable.

The first two approaches are established through scripture and reasoning. Thus, regarding the nature of the path itself, it is termed the Mahāyāna possessing four special qualities. These approaches are explained extensively in the Yuktiṣaṣṭikā, Ratnāvalī, Mahāyānottaratantra, Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi and other texts, so they should be understood from those sources. Although this presentation of the nature of the path itself is not taught by the venerable guru here, it is written from what he taught elsewhere, as it is relevant to this context. How is it relevant? When making divisions of the path here, without a general [classification of] path, the basis of division would not be established and the divisions would not be elegant. Furthermore, without understanding the general [nature of] Mahāyāna, which includes both Secret Mantra and Pāramitā, misconceptions would arise. Indeed, here in the Land of Snows, we see some practitioners of Secret Mantra and some who claim to be Mahāyāna Śrāvakas narrowly conceiving of Mahāyāna itself and carelessly treating the tantric texts. Therefore, to dispel such misconceptions, the basis of division is explained in this context. This was the second chapter, on the nature of the path itself, from the General Presentation of the Classes of Tantra. 2. Regarding the divisions of the path, there are four topics:
1. Basis of division
2. Meaning of the divisions
3. Determining the number
4. Etymology

1. The first is the Mahāyāna as explained above, in terms of both scriptural systems and path-result. This is the basis of division. When divided, there are two:
1. Pāramitāyāna
2. Mantrayāna.

The Mahāyāna that lacks these four special qualities is called the Pāramitāyāna, while that which is distinguished by the four special qualities is called the Mantrayāna. These two paths are not mutually exclusive or contradictory divisions, but rather divisions of general and specific, or superior and non-superior. Here, the general is the Pāramitāyāna, as it comprises the paths common to both. The specific is the Vajrayāna, as it is superior due to its profound and vast qualities not found in the other. The distinctions between these two will be explained in detail below. This was regarding the meaning of the divisions. 3. Regarding the third point of establishing the definitive number as two, there are two parts:
1. Establishing two paths
2. Establishing two results

Each of these has two aspects:
1. Through reasoning
2. Through scripture

Regarding the first, the logical reasoning for establishing the definitive number of paths as two is that since all dharmas are taught for the sake of disciples as the basis to be trained, there are two types of disciples:

Generally, for those with lesser afflictions and specifically those with little attachment to desires and who wish to attain enlightenment by abandoning these, who are of lesser faculties, the Pāramitāyāna was taught. For certain individuals who generally have greater afflictions and specifically have great attachment to desires which they cannot abandon, yet who wish to attain unsurpassed enlightenment and who have sharp faculties, the Mantrayāna was taught. If you think: "Since Secret Mantra was taught to those with greater afflictions, and since having greater afflictions is inferior, wouldn't that mean Secret Mantra is not superior?".

This is not an inferior path just because it was taught for those with greater afflictions. Being inferior means being unable to apply the antidote. Moreover, it is actually a greater method precisely because it conquers those greater afflictions. As stated in the Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṅkāra:

"For those endowed with great methods,
Afflictions become factors of enlightenment. Because saṃsāra has the nature of peace,
The bodhisattvas are thus inconceivable. "

This is like how a small fire cannot be used with large fuel, but when the fire is large, even a large amount of fuel becomes a support for the flames. If one thinks: "If both Pāramitāyāna and Secret Mantra have methods for all three types of disciples - those with greater, medium and lesser afflictions - what is the point of making distinctions?" It is not contradictory that there are subdivisions within each. Thus, since there are definitively two types of disciples, the paths are also definitively established as two. 2. Establishing through scripture: As stated in the Samyaksambodhisūtra: "This Mahāyāna is indeed the Great Vehicle - the path of bodhisattvas together with its result. Therefore, it is established in the Pāramitā sūtras through the seven types of greatness. This Vajrayāna, which is even more extraordinary, becomes supreme in qualities since it accomplishes buddhahood and so forth in this very life. "

Also, Ācārya Buddhaguhya stated in the Piṇḍārtha of the Vairocana-abhisambodhi: "The accomplishment of perfect purpose for self and others is taught through Secret Mantra conduct and through the sūtras that teach Pāramitā conduct. ".

2. Regarding the second general point - the definite existence of two results - there are two parts:

1. Through reasoning
2. Through scripture

1. The reasoning is: It is natural that when there is a distinction in the cause, there will be a distinction in the result. For example, like kautapa and śāli rice. Therefore, since there are two paths, there will also be two results. 2. Regarding scripture: As stated in the Samyaksambodhisūtra: "In this birth, one will attain either buddhahood or vajrasattvahood. Those who have not attained the inconceivable state are sugatas, who are buddhas. The actual subject indicated is the authentic Vajrasattva. "

This shows that the result of the Pāramitāyāna is not having obtained all abandonments and attainments, while the result of Vajrayāna is actualizing everything. This should be understood in detail through scripture and reasoning. The meanings of the names of these two paths are:
1. That which teaches Pāramitā conduct
2. That which teaches Secret Mantra conduct

Or alternatively:
1. The Great Vehicle in general
2. The Vajra Vehicle

The various synonyms like "Bodhisattva Collection" and "Vidyādhara Collection" should be understood as applying specific names to general categories. A general name refers to just the general category, while a specific name refers to a particular instance within that category. For example, it is like distinguishing between "copper" and "copper pot. "

How do we know this is so? As stated in the Vajraśekhara:
"The practice of the six perfections
Is explained by the Teacher as conceptual. "

Also, in the Mother of the Victorious Ones (Prajñāpāramitā), it states: "The perfection of wisdom is secret mantra, called the secret mantra of great awareness" and so forth. Therefore, these names are given based on what is predominant.

These are also known as:
1. The vehicle that abandons the basis and the vehicle that does not abandon the basis
2. The causal vehicle and the resultant vehicle
3. The common Mahāyāna and the uncommon Mahāyāna

These are specific, definitive names. The explanation of the literal meaning of these names will be explained in the section on their individual characteristics. This was the third chapter from the general presentation of the tantra collections, concerning the detailed classification of paths. Having understood the detailed classification of paths, in order to make this clear, the characteristics of each path will now be explained. First, we will present the system of the Pāramitāyāna path, since it is the foundation of the path and is common. After that, we will present the system of Secret Mantra, since it teaches what is superior to that. The first has four parts:
1. Establishing the basis by which one becomes either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa
2. Teaching how to make the path by abandoning the basis
3. Presenting the system of the Pāramitāyāna path
4. Incidentally establishing it as the causal vehicle while teaching the time of accomplishing the result through that path

The first has two parts:
1. The characteristics of the basis
2. Establishing how that basis is the common cause of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa

Regarding the first, while the term "basis" generally applies to five aspects - cause, condition, prerequisites, antecedents, and support - here it refers to the conditional cause. What is this cause? While extensively it can be divided into many categories like aggregates, elements, sense-bases and so forth, when condensed it is the five sensual pleasures.

How are they condensed into five? While mind is the agent of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and its objects are the six or twelve sense objects, since all of these are included within just these five and what follows from them, these five are the basis.

2. Regarding the second point - whether this basis is common to both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa or specific to each - it is common. One might think: "Since those desiring nirvāṇa must abandon the basis, how can it be common?"

Although abandonment is true, the very objects of abandonment must be taken as objects, and thus they are established as the basis for nirvāṇa as well. As stated in the Abhidharma: "These themselves are the basis for discourse in time, along with definite emergence and basis." And: "Suffering, origin, the world, divine abodes and existence are also these."

Regarding how this first acts as the basis for saṃsāra: First, one experiences objects. Not knowing their nature there, attachment arises through grasping to self and mine. Based on that, various conceptual thoughts arise - this is called ignorance, craving and grasping. These are the afflictive defilements. Based on those, performing virtuous and non-virtuous actions is formation and becoming. These two are the karmic defilements. From that, the seven factors of consciousness, name-and-form, six sense bases, contact, feeling, birth, and aging-and-death are suffering - the defilements of birth. Thus the twelve links of existence revolve through the three defilements. As stated in the Lalitavistara:

Through the power of craving, becoming and ignorance, beings
Circle through the three realms of humans, gods and bad migrations,
Not knowing the five destinies they wander,
Like a potter's wheel turning round and round. How does this become the basis for nirvāṇa? First, one experiences objects. Then through analyzing them, one knows their nature. Through that, attachment does not arise. Through that, ignorance ceases. Therefore, one does not create karma. When karma is not created, the afflictive defilements of birth do not arise and gradually cease. As stated in the Madhyamaka:

"Through the cessation of ignorance,
Through meditation on reality with wisdom,
Through the cessation of this and that,
This and that will not manifest. "

Therefore, it depends on one's own knowledge and ignorance. The objects themselves do not inherently determine whether they become a basis for saṃsāra or nirvāṇa. For example, it is like: whichever weapon is stronger in battle; or how a śleṣa flower smells fragrant when eaten by a white elephant but foul when eaten by a black elephant; or how milk becomes nectar for humans but poison for snakes; or how a jewel can be an ornament when whole but not when broken - it depends on conditions. Therefore, as stated in the Glorious Hevajra Tantra:

"Thus the five qualities
That are desired in saṃsāra
Become poison when impure,
But like nectar when pure. "

This explains the basis. Regarding the second general point - how the Pāramitāyāna makes the path by abandoning the basis - there are two parts:
1. Viewing objects as unfavorable
2. The method of abandoning them

1. When one properly examines the sufferings of saṃsāra, one becomes disenchanted.

When one becomes disenchanted and investigates "From what cause did this suffering arise?", one finds it arises from karma. That arises from afflictive emotions. Those afflictive emotions arise in dependence on objects. Therefore, one develops the perception that objects are unfavorable, thinking "Objects are the cause of suffering. " Furthermore, it is taught in many ways that "Objects are insatiable" and so forth. As stated in the sūtras: "Desires are like poisonous leaves" and so forth. Also from the Letter to a Student:

"Objects are like poison - initially pleasant when experienced,
Objects are like poison - their ripening is harsh and unbearable, 
Objects are like poison - they envelope one in the darkness of delusion,
Objects are like poison - difficult to reverse and deceptive. "

Through contemplating their unfavorable nature in many such ways, one develops the perception that freedom from desire is happiness. 2. Regarding the actual method of abandoning the basis:

First of all, being afraid of saṃsāra, one goes for refuge in the Three Jewels and takes vows of moral discipline to abandon [negative actions]. After that, through hearing reliable scripture and reasoning, one comes to understand the nature of objects through contemplation. Subsequently, through meditation one abandons all attachment to objects. This has two parts:
1. Meditation on the conventional level
2. Meditation on the ultimate level 

1. For those with predominant attachment, one meditates on unattractiveness. For those with predominant conceptual thought, one practices breath counting, following the breath, and so forth. For those with anger, one practices loving-kindness and so forth to stabilize the mind. After that, as an antidote to the four mistaken views - seeing things as pure, pleasant, permanent and having self - one should meditate on the four foundations of mindfulness, and so forth.

2. For meditation on the ultimate level, one abandons [attachment] by meditating on all phenomena as lacking inherent nature. As stated:

"Desires, riches, and the three realms of existence,
The Victor taught are like illusions, mirages, moon reflections in water, and magical creations."

This completes the explanation of the method of abandoning the basis.

If one wonders "Since even śrāvakas have this path of merely abandoning the basis, how is the Pāramitāyāna superior?", it is true that in general the earlier paths are mostly common, while the later ones are superior. Thus, while merely abandoning the basis is common to both Pāramitāyāna and śrāvakas, the Mahāyāna is superior through its view and conduct as explained earlier.

3. The systematic presentation of the Pāramitāyāna path has two parts:
1. Presentation of the nature of the path itself
2. The way of developing direct realizations of that path

1. Regarding the first, what is the nature of the path itself? While there are inconceivable different ways of presenting the path, 

here it is condensed into what are called the six pāramitās - conduct motivated by great compassion. When divided according to the practice of the Prajñāpāramitā, these become the ten pāramitās. As stated in the Madhyāntavibhāga:

"Generosity, discipline, patience, diligence,
Meditation and wisdom, method,
Aspiration, power and pristine wisdom - 
These are accepted as the ten pāramitās."

These ten [pāramitās] have innumerable presentations such as their divisions, the three trainings, condensation into the two accumulations, and so forth, which should be sought elsewhere. 2. How do direct realizations of this path arise? As stated in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra, there are ten stages:

"The [spiritually mature] lineage and faith in the Dharma,
Likewise generating bodhicitta,
Practicing generosity and so forth,
Engaging in what is flawless,
Bringing beings to maturity,
Purifying the buddha-field,
Non-abiding nirvāṇa,
Supreme enlightenment and teaching. "

Also, four stages are taught:
"Attaining the grounds through faith,
Engaging in conduct,
For realization, and
Fourth, through accomplishment of the grounds. "

By the term "grounds" one should understand everything explained earlier such as generating bodhicitta, the pāramitās and so forth. First arises what is called the cause of being fortunate - the [spiritually mature] lineage. Then, motivated by compassion, one takes refuge in the Three Jewels and develops faith in the Dharma. Then arises the foundation for engaging in conduct - generating bodhicitta. Then arises the actual practice of the pāramitās. These four constitute the ground of acting through faith. Then comes what is called "bodhisattvas engaging in what is flawless" - attaining the first ground. Then comes "bringing beings to maturity" up through the seventh ground. Then "purifying the field" and "non-abiding nirvāṇa" constitute the three irreversible grounds. These are the path. Then comes enlightenment - manifesting perfect enlightenment and teaching the great nirvāṇa. Working for the benefit of beings is the fruit.

Thus, through conduct that is completely pure in the three spheres, one progresses to buddhahood through the six pāramitās, hence it is called "pāramitā." Moreover, it is called a "vehicle" (yāna) because one travels by this path, or because one travels to this result. 

If one asks "How long does it take to accomplish the result through this path?", for the sharpest it takes three countless eons, for the middling thirty-six, and for the lowest an inconceivable number. Therefore, since the cause takes a long time, it is labeled "causal vehicle." This is like calling someone with a slow gait "gaitless." 

Alternatively, it is called a "cause" because presently there is not even a similarity to the result - through causes like welcoming the guru and so forth, one accomplishes different results like having the marks of wheels on hands and feet. This is like calling a sprout "the cause of barley." That is sufficient elaboration.

The result accomplished through this path is as explained above.

This completes the explanation of the systematic presentation of the Pāramitāyāna, the common path.

Now, regarding the systematic presentation of the second path, there are four parts:
1. The way of not abandoning the basis
2. The systematic presentation of secret mantra conduct 
3. The systematic presentation of Vajrayāna
4. An ancillary explanation of the systematic presentation of the resultant vehicle along with teaching the time of accomplishing the result

The first has three parts:
1. The reasoning for not abandoning the basis
2. The methods for not abandoning
3. The way of becoming liberated from that

Regarding the first, the basis was explained earlier as the five sensual pleasures. Since these themselves are the basis and the objects, how can they be abandoned? Moreover, even those who are greatly afflicted cannot abandon them, so they should not be abandoned. Therefore, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:

Thus, how could those who are greatly afflicted abandon them? They should not be abandoned. Therefore, as stated in the Vajrapañjara:

"The worldly beings produced by desire
Will be liberated through desire itself. "

And as stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"Those with desire, through wisdom and desire,
Should always rely on the five sensual pleasures. "

If one asks "Won't one be bound by the objects?", those without method will be bound, like ordinary beings. But for those with method, those very things become aids to liberation, like poison or fire and so forth. Therefore, objects do not bind by their own nature - it is conceptual confusion dependent on them that binds. Thus, by abandoning the cause of bondage in its own nature, one is liberated, and the objects that were conditions for bondage become conditions for liberation. As stated in the glorious Hevajra:

"Whatever binds beings
To their terrible karma,
That very thing, when combined with method,
Liberates from the bonds of existence. "

If one asks what is this method mentioned in "combined with method" that abandons the causes of bondage, the second part - the methods for not abandoning the basis - has two parts:
1. Skill in the methods of generation stage
2. Skill in the methods of completion stage

The first has two parts:
1. Skill in the methods of one's special personal deity
2. Skill in the methods of individual deities

Regarding the first, one recognizes whatever objects and subjects appear as one's single deity and enjoys them. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"All desired enjoyments
Should be enjoyed as desired,
Through union with one's deity,
Make offerings to self and others. "

Similarly, this is taught in other texts as well.

That is for transforming ordinary conceptual thoughts for those who prefer concise practice. 2. Regarding skill in the methods of individual deities, one makes infinite divisions of objects and subjects, and recognizes each of these individually as deities. As stated in the glorious Guhyasamāja:

"In brief, the five aggregates are the Victors,
They are all the Tathāgatas. These vajra sense fields too
Are the supreme maṇḍala of bodhisattvas. "

And as stated in the glorious Hevajra:

"Form is renowned as Gaurī,
Sound's aspect is Caurī. "

This destroys all ordinary grasping and conceptual thoughts of grasping things as whole entities for those who delight in elaborate practice. Thus, the cause of bondage is ordinary conceptual thought. When one recognizes these as deities, ordinary perception ceases and everything is gradually abandoned. 2. Regarding skill in the methods of completion stage, relying on whatever method is appropriate, one gives rise to non-conceptual samādhi, and through that transforms the colors of objects and enjoys them. As stated in the Later Guhyasamāja Tantra:

"Through the yoga of completion stage
Arising from method and wisdom,
The mantrin should definitely practice yoga
With aggregates, elements, sense fields and forms. "

Thus, since the cause of bondage is conceptual thought, by clearing away concepts through non-conceptual samādhi, all bonds are gradually released. 3. Regarding the way of becoming liberated from that: In general, the cause of bondage is mere conceptual thought, and specifically ordinary conceptual thought.

By relying on that, afflictions and so forth arise gradually. Therefore, through these two methods, when one clears away the causes in their own essence, objects transform their colors and become aids to the antidote, so one relies on objects as in the previous example. As stated in the Second Stage:

"Having made these pure and free from poison,
One should rely upon these very objects."

At first, the antidote is weak and objects are harmful, appearing as enemies. Similarly, through reliance, in the middle when their powers are equal, sometimes harm and sometimes benefit arise - this is called the time of variegated appearances. These two receive the name "meditative equipoise." Finally, when the antidote becomes powerful, objects aid realization.

At that point, it is called the time when appearances arise as spiritual friends. This is called "the five poisons becoming medicine." Since samādhi arises continuously, it is called "perfect equipoise." As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:

"Whatever sense faculty and path,
That becomes its very nature.
Through yoga without equipoise,
There is always perfect equipoise."

And it speaks of continuous yoga in verses like "Various forms in the belly..." 

2. Regarding the second meaning: This very method of not abandoning the basis as explained above is called Mantra practice. How is it Mantra practice? 1. What is the meaning of mantra and 2. What is its practice. 

1. Regarding the first, there are five parts:
1.1 What is the general cause of mantras arising
1.2 What are mantra words
1.3 The meaning of mantras
1.4 The divisions of mantras
1.5 The etymology of mantras

The etymology of mantra, or the explanation of its verbal meaning, should be understood extensively elsewhere. Here, for now, the ultimate meaning of mantra is that it protects the mind from characteristics and conceptual thoughts, and its corresponding practice is the samaya of the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. As stated in the latter part of the glorious Guhyasamāja Tantra:

"From the conditions of faculties and objects,
Whatever arises in the mind is called 'man. '
'Tra' means that which protects. What is explained as freedom from worldly conduct
Is the samaya commitment. Protected by all vajras,
This is explained as mantra practice. "

And from the Dbang yon tan rim pa:

"The verbal meaning of mantra is explained as
Non-dual emptiness and compassion:
'Emptiness and compassion itself,
Non-dual and the way of two,
From that is explained as secret mantra. '"

All other explanations taught in the Vajraśekhara and elsewhere should be understood elsewhere. 3. This very [practice] is called the Vajrayāna because:

Here, vajra refers to the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. Yāna means "that by which one travels," referring to the path, and "where one travels to," referring to the result. Regarding this, it is a yāna because one travels by means of the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. First, one generates bodhicitta similarly to the perfection [vehicle]. Then, at the time of entering the maṇḍala and receiving empowerment, the master consecrates the disciple's body, speech, and mind as the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas.

Then, without being separate from that, at the time of practicing the two stages of the path, one engages with the body, speech, and mind as the vajra body, speech, and mind of the buddhas. Then, by recognizing that the three - body, speech, and mind - and all afflictions are of vajra nature, this becomes progressively clearer and clearer - this is the path. When the result of the thirteenth bhūmi is accomplished from that, the actual realization of vajra body, speech, and mind is what one travels by, hence it is called a yāna. As stated in the Guhyasamāja:

"Desire, hatred, and delusion
Always abide delighting in the vajra. Therefore, the method of all buddhas
Is explained as the Vajrayāna. "

4. The presentation of the resultant vehicle:
When is this Vajrayāna accomplished? For superior individuals, it is accomplished in this very life. For middling ones, it is accomplished in the intermediate state. For inferior ones, in seven lifetimes. For the very inferior, it is accomplished within sixteen lifetimes. Regarding the first, from the Guhyasamāja:

"Through this great dharma nature,
Arising from the indivisible three kāyas,
Adorned by the ocean of wisdom,
It will be accomplished in this very life. "

Accomplishment in the intermediate state comes from the guru's speech. As stated in the Jñānabindu:

"Even those who lack diligence
Will accomplish it right after leaving the body. "

This shows accomplishment in the intermediate state right after leaving the body. Regarding accomplishment in seven lifetimes, from the Guhyagarbha:

"When given proper empowerment,
One will receive empowerment life after life. Through this, in seven lifetimes,
Accomplishment is gained even without meditation. "

Regarding accomplishment in sixteen lifetimes, from the Pañcasamaya:

"If one is without downfalls,
Accomplishment comes in sixteen lifetimes. ".

From the Vajraśekhara: 

"What cannot be attained through the perfections
Even in countless kalpas - 
If that yogin is diligent,
They will pass beyond suffering in this very life.
Or merely through seeing,
They will pass beyond in sixteen lives.
Even ordinary beings will accomplish
Buddhahood itself, not otherwise."

Therefore, since the result is accomplished with little difficulty, it is called the resultant vehicle. Alternatively, it is called the resultant vehicle because one meditates on the aspects of the result from the beginning, as stated in texts like "The five aspects of enlightenment, the virtuous essence of all buddhas..."

Thus, according to the Mantra system, the result along with its path is completely realized in a single instance right now. Therefore, it is called the resultant vehicle because it resembles the result, just as an extremely beautiful person is called a deity. This is the unique path.

4. This was the section on establishing the characteristics of individual paths from "The General Presentation of Tantra Classes."

Having thus explained the presentation of individual paths, I will now show how the conduct of Secret Mantra is superior in terms of special timing.

Regarding how it is superior in terms of special timing, as stated by Master Kṛṣṇapāda in the Nayatrayapradīpa:

"Though the meaning is one, it is superior
Due to lack of confusion, many methods,
Absence of hardship, and being for those
Of sharp faculties."

This has three parts:
1. Teaching that the meaning to be realized is one

1. Teaching that the meaning to be realized is one, 2. The actual way in which the method of realization is superior, and 3. Dispelling objections to this.

Regarding the first, there is no difference in the ultimate nature (dharmadhātu) to be realized, the result of buddhahood to be attained, and the method of bodhicitta that accomplishes it. However, the method of giving rise to these in one's mindstream is superior in four ways:

1. Not being confused about the view of realization
2. Having many methods for accomplishing the result
3. Accomplishing enlightenment without hardship
4. Being for those of sharp faculties who accomplish the result quickly

Regarding the first, in general what is called "the view" is the natural state of phenomena. All Mahāyāna traditions agree that without realizing this natural state, which is free from elaboration, one cannot attain enlightenment. Therefore, while the Pāramitāyāna establishes realization through examples, logic and so forth, no matter how it is established, the understanding remains merely conceptual, fixating on one extreme of elaboration. In contrast, the Mantra tradition is superior because when wisdom arises in one's mindstream at the time of receiving the third empowerment and so forth, one directly realizes freedom from elaboration.

2. Regarding the many methods, there are two parts:
1. Many methods for accomplishing common results
2. Many methods for accomplishing supreme results

First, the common results range from invisibility and clairvoyance up to great enjoyments, great wisdom, and long life. Unlike the Pāramitāyāna which accomplishes these gradually through methods like generosity and so forth.

The perfection vehicle only accomplishes these gradually through methods like generosity, or if one desires them in this life, there are no other methods besides those common with worldly people. The mantra practitioner, however, accomplishes these effortlessly through countless methods of practice like Mañjuśrī and Vasudhārā, which also become aids for enlightenment. 2. Regarding the many methods for accomplishing supreme results, there are two parts:
1. Methods for realizing ultimate profound meaning
2. Methods for realizing conventional extensive meaning

Regarding the first, in the perfection vehicle there is nothing beyond mere intellectual understanding that "it is free from elaboration. " In contrast, even by just meditating on the generation stage, the mantra vehicle teaches the sixteen emptinesses with sixteen arms and so forth. Through the completion stage, it gives rise to non-conceptual samādhi through inconceivable methods like caṇḍālī. Regarding extensive realization, there are two parts:
1. Extensive realization such as arrangement of world systems
2. Extensive conduct and so forth

While the perfection vehicle only has general aspects of these, in the mantra vehicle one understands both completely just by meditating on a single maṇḍala. Through inconceivable methods like torma offerings and so forth, one can both realize and engage in both aspects. Therefore, it is superior due to having many methods. 3. Regarding accomplishing without hardship - while the perfection vehicle is a path of austerities and hardships requiring great effort, the mantra vehicle accomplishes enlightenment through pleasant conduct. Therefore it is superior. 4. Regarding being for those of sharp faculties - the followers of the perfection vehicle have dull faculties. Even at their fastest, it takes three countless eons to attain complete enlightenment.

The followers of mantra achieve it in this very life if they are of superior capacity, in the intermediate state if of medium capacity, and even those of lowest capacity achieve it within seven or sixteen lives. This has already been explained earlier in the sections on causal and resultant vehicles. Therefore, it is superior.

3. Regarding dispelling objections to this superiority, there are four parts:
1. Dispelling objections that they have the same meaning
2. Dispelling objections that the four distinctions are invalid
3. Dispelling objections that it contradicts the divisions of scripture or baskets
4. Dispelling objections that it is not time to practice secret mantra

Regarding the first, there are two parts:
1. Refuting arguments of non-equivalence
2. Refuting arguments that if equivalent, it would follow that it is interpretable meaning

Regarding the first: Some foolish people who have developed aversion to the profound meaning of the perfection vehicle and thus become hostile to the vajra vehicle argue: "The secret mantra vehicle and perfection vehicle are different in meaning, because while the perfection vehicle explains the divisions of the Buddha's form bodies and wisdoms, the divisions of grounds and perfections, emptiness and compassion and so forth, the vajra vehicle explains generation stage, completion stage and so forth - therefore they are not the same in meaning."

This is incorrect. The secret mantra vehicle also teaches those very meanings. As stated in the Noble Māyājāla:
"The system of the ten perfections,
The lord of the ten grounds,
The one dwelling on the ten grounds,
Possessing the nature of the ten pure wisdoms."

And in the Vajrapañjara Tantra...

And in the Vajrapañjara Tantra:
"Emptiness and compassion are not different.
Where mind is perfectly meditated upon,
That is the teaching of the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha as well."

Does this not encompass all vehicles? Similarly, I have not written all the scriptural sources from all tantras due to fear of too many words. Furthermore, the secret mantra teaches all of these completely in just meditating on a single generation stage maṇḍala, or even just one's own body alone. As it is said: "The incomparable square has four mindfulness gates" and so forth. Therefore, those who speak without understanding the meaning of the scriptures are worthy of contempt.

2. If one objects: "If the meaning is equivalent in this way, it would be sufficient to teach just that meaning alone. But since it teaches squares and so forth, by applying different words and different meanings to the secret mantra meaning, it becomes interpretable meaning."

This is incorrect. Let us ask this question: "What is the distinction between interpretable meaning and definitive meaning?"

If one responds: "Interpretable meaning refers to methods taught to lead those of lesser capacity to the authentic meaning, while definitive refers to what is authentic, taught for those of appropriate capacity. As stated in the Madhyamakāvatāra: 'Know that sūtras not teaching suchness are interpretable meaning, while those teaching emptiness are definitive meaning.'"

We would ask: "Does emptiness or authentic meaning refer to what is taught as the aspect of wisdom's negation? Or is definitive meaning referring to the non-duality of the two truths?"

If one asks this question, and one responds: "The definitive meaning is that which teaches the non-duality of the two truths as free from elaboration," we would ask: "Does this refer to what is taught explicitly or what is taught implicitly?"

If one says "explicitly," this cannot be taught by anyone, as even the Buddha himself could not express it directly, as stated by Ācārya Padmavajra: "That very suchness cannot be expressed even by the Victor. "

Even the Noble Vimalakīrti was unable to teach it and remained silent. If one argues: "Though it cannot be taught explicitly, sūtras containing terms like 'non-dual' and 'emptiness' are definitive meaning," then although such terms are also taught in secret mantra, merely knowing these terms does not constitute understanding suchness. Just as understanding arises gradually through relying on terms, realization of equality also arises through squares and so forth, therefore secret mantra is definitive meaning. Furthermore, since all Buddha's speech implicitly teaches this way, one cannot distinguish between interpretable and definitive meaning sūtras. If one thinks: "Definitive meaning refers to what teaches the aspect of wisdom's negation," such teachings are also abundant in secret mantra. Moreover, the perfection vehicle also has interpretable meaning since it teaches many aspects of aggregates, elements, sense bases, grounds and paths. Therefore, since both secret mantra and perfection sūtras each contain inconceivable aspects, they are all taught with complexity. For this reason, Noble Maitreya explained all sūtras through the divisions of the four intentions and four indirect expressions.

In the Noble Bodhisattva Piṭaka, eight different characteristics of interpretable and definitive meaning are explained:

1. Path engagement is interpretable meaning,
While result engagement is definitive meaning.
2. Conventional proof is interpretable meaning,
While ultimate proof is definitive meaning.
3. Engagement in karmic activities is interpretable,
While exhaustion of karma and afflictions is definitive.
4. Teaching afflictions is interpretable,
While teaching purification is definitive meaning.
5. Generating weariness with saṃsāra is interpretable,
While non-duality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is definitive.
6. Teaching various words and syllables is interpretable,
While profound difficult realization is definitive.
7. Many words pleasing beings is interpretable,
While few words easy to grasp is definitive.
8. Teaching self and so forth primarily is interpretable,
While teaching selflessness is definitive meaning.

Even according to these, secret mantra appears to be mostly definitive meaning. Furthermore, if one thinks: "By this reasoning that what is taught as the four foundations of mindfulness in the perfection vehicle is taught as the four gates and so forth in secret mantra, secret mantra would be interpretable meaning."

There is nowhere that such explanations are described as interpretable meaning. Even if it were interpretable meaning, for that very reason secret mantra is also definitive meaning. Regarding those aspects of enlightenment like the four foundations of mindfulness and so forth, there are three aspects:
1. The name
2. The practice 
3. The perfection

While the mere names are similar, they are first taught in the perfection vehicle to attract beginners. Teaching that "it is similar here" has the purpose of removing doubts about the path. Regarding the second, in terms of practice

2. Regarding practice, in the perfection vehicle one follows after names and gradually practices only general aspects, so it is long. In secret mantra, one follows after the meaning and immediately generates realization, teaching simultaneous practice, therefore this path is swift and supreme.

Regarding perfection of the result, since it is established through realization, that is taught as the suchness of maṇḍala and so forth. Although genuine wisdom exists at the sixth bhūmi in the perfection vehicle too, since there currently exists a gradual path of practice in accordance with that, they are equivalent. Therefore, since the final result is similar, they have the same meaning, and it is established that secret mantra primarily teaches definitive meaning.

2. Regarding the refutation of objections that the four distinctions are invalid, there are three parts:
1. Refuting the objection that the four distinctions are equivalent 
2. Refuting the objection that if they are not equivalent, the path would be mistaken
3. Refuting the objection that Kriyā tantras would not be secret mantra

1. The opponent argues: The Pāramitāyāna proponents say: "You Vajrayāna practitioners claim superiority through four distinctions, but these are actually equivalent to the Pāramitāyāna. Is being undeluded referring to the path or to persons? For the path, being deluded or undeluded is not tenable. As for persons, deluded ones are seen among mantra practitioners and undeluded ones are seen among Pāramitāyāna practitioners."

"2. Furthermore, regarding having many methods - this too is equivalent, since inconceivable divisions of the path are seen in the three characteristics, two truths, six perfections and so forth."

"3. Regarding the absence of hardship, this too is similar, since

in the Pāramitāyāna, it is explained that bodhisattva Dharmodgata and sixty-eight thousand women simultaneously enjoyed the five qualities of desire, and it is said that bodhisattva Sadāprarudita was together with five hundred maidens including the merchant's daughter. It is also taught that some bodhisattvas definitely need a wife and children. 

4. Regarding sharp faculties, this too is equivalent, since it is taught in the Great Secret Skillful Means that bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena can attain unsurpassed enlightenment in even seven days if they wish. For a beginner, there is nothing swifter than accomplishing enlightenment in three countless eons. Therefore, the four distinctions are equivalent."

The response: What you have explained about the paths being equivalent is partially true from certain perspectives. This actually accords with our position and establishes that the path of secret mantra is undisputed and has the same meaning. However, secret mantra is taught to be qualitatively superior to that.

Regarding your first question about whether being undeluded refers to the path or persons - deluded and undeluded refer to persons, and it is true that both exist. While it is also true that being deluded or undeluded are not paths themselves, there are paths that teach delusion and paths that teach non-delusion. Therefore, since mantra directly teaches suchness through examples, it is a path that makes persons undeluded.

Regarding the first point, since secret mantra directly teaches suchness through examples, it is a path that makes persons undeluded, while the perfection vehicle does not teach in this way and is therefore a path that makes persons deluded.

2. Regarding the claim that having many methods is equivalent - while it is true that many methods are explained in the perfection vehicle, secret mantra practitioners do not abandon those paths. Moreover, secret mantra is superior because it has inconceivable additional methods like the two stages of supreme and common accomplishment, mantra recitation, fire offerings and so forth, as explained previously.

3. Regarding the claim that absence of hardship is equivalent - those examples from the perfection vehicle refer to noble beings. Dharmodgata had attained dhāraṇī, and Sadāprarudita attained the path of accumulation upon hearing sounds from space, the path of preparation while practicing austerities, and the path of seeing when attaining non-coming and non-going. For such beings, desires do not bind them. The other cases were taught to accommodate beings with desire. In secret mantra, when one is held by the special methods, one becomes enlightened, thus it is superior. If you think the perfection vehicle also allows desire for beginners - that is taught as appropriate for those unable to abandon desire, but is not made into the path itself.

4. Regarding the claim that sharp faculties are equivalent - attaining acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena refers to the eighth bhūmi, but it takes two more countless eons after reaching that. This is extremely long. In secret mantra, through the power of a beginner's diligence, one can attain enlightenment in this life, at death, in the bardo, or within seven or sixteen lifetimes - thus the faculties are much sharper. The scriptural sources were given above in the section on results.

2. Refuting the objection that if they are not equivalent, the path would be mistaken. This has three parts:
1. Refuting the objection that seeing the truth requires being undeluded
2. Refuting the objection that having many methods without hardship makes the path mistaken
3. Refuting the objection that since sharp faculties and vast conduct are not taught, it equals the śrāvaka path

1. Some argue: "When you Vajrayāna practitioners generate wisdom during empowerment and meditation, and the guru generates certainty by saying 'This is suchness' - is that direct suchness itself or is it just a method indicating it? If you say it's a method, how is it different from logical reasoning like neither one nor many? If you say it's direct suchness, then it would be seeing the truth itself. "

In response to this, some confused people say: "We accept that, since there is no difference between seeing suchness and realizing this. " Well then, since your own body and appearances are not separate from mind, and when mind becomes free from concepts, what use are these characteristics and grasping since they are established as unobstructed? If you think "This yogin's body is temporarily bound, but when discarding it one will be liberated," then by that logic you would need to create a reason for dying. If you think "One will fall," then since even those who have attained acceptance do not go to lower realms, where could one who has seen the truth fall to? This is laughable! If you think "I have accomplished it, you just haven't seen it due to being impure," if you do not lie about yourself that is good - may it not become manifest pride! Even if you have seen just a little bit.

If you say "Then it would not be the path of seeing of the first bhūmi since it was already seen before. " If you say "I realized it before and now am experiencing it," in that case, since one could degenerate even after realizing suchness, the path of seeing would also degenerate, which is laughable. Furthermore, it would follow that at the time of realizing suchness, one should be able to display qualities like shaking a hundred billion world systems. Since there is no difference in realization, it is a natural fact that for those who have no difference in realization, there is no difference in qualities - like the buddhas. For those who claim it is actual wisdom, these and countless other faults arise. We accept it as just an example. If you ask "Then what is the difference from methods like reasoning about being neither one nor many?" There is a difference - those only bring understanding that there is no inherent nature, but do not make the mind free from concepts. It is like explaining the moon in terms of color and shape to someone who wants to see it. Here, the wisdom realized during empowerment and so forth is similar to the wisdom of the path of seeing in being free from elaboration, like using the moon's reflection in water as an example for someone who wants to see the moon. Therefore, even though one is not deluded, it does not become seeing the truth. Furthermore, if one does not meditate after realizing the example wisdom, since this is called the coming and going of wisdom, that wisdom will cease due to being obscured by great obscurations. Therefore, this yogin should not become extremely proud of their realization - they need to make great effort through diligence itself. If not, since it is not actual wisdom, its cessation is natural.

2. The objection that since there are many methods and no hardship, the path becomes misguided:

"This claim about many methods of accomplishing supreme siddhis through generation stage, channels, winds, drops and so forth being methods for realizing suchness is incorrect. The generation stage only results in the form kāya, and its suchness is the same as in the perfections. Since the non-Buddhists also have many methods involving drops, channels, winds and so forth, how could these be valid methods? Moreover, regarding the many methods for accomplishing ordinary siddhis - since these methods of killing and summoning beings harm sentient beings, how could there be enlightenment in this? Even a good rebirth would become distant.

Also, the claim that 'Since there is no hardship, enlightenment is accomplished through bliss' - if this were accomplished through indulging in desires, all ordinary beings would be accomplished. And if one could engage with objects through understanding suchness without being defiled and thereby achieve accomplishment - this would be equivalent to the Sāṃkhya view."

In response: Regarding the objection that one cannot accomplish through generation stage - even the secret mantras themselves state that mere attachment to the aspects of generation will not bring accomplishment. However, by meditating on completion stage while understanding that, one will gain union and become liberated through understanding its suchness. Therefore, there is a distinction from the perfections, because:
1. Even in a single deity's suchness, all objects of knowledge - both nature and extent - are established
2. All paths including the six perfections are included
3. The accumulations are completed continuously

Continuously completing the accumulations and directly accomplishing inconceivable purposes such as pacifying all adverse conditions in this life make it superior.

Regarding the objection that "since non-Buddhists also have practices involving winds and so forth, these are not valid paths," one should ask this question: Do you reject everything that exists among non-Buddhists or not? If you do not reject them, remain silent. If you reject them, since non-Buddhists also have generosity, moral discipline and so forth, these would have to be rejected.

To this, if one responds: "Because they are distinguished by being embraced by the three refuges, bodhicitta, and complete purity of the three spheres, they are different from non-Buddhist generosity and so forth," here too the same applies - we can similarly reverse the argument: through meditating on channels, winds, drops and so forth while being embraced by the three refuges, bodhicitta and complete purity of the three spheres, these are superior to non-Buddhist practices.

Regarding the objection that "the many methods like killing and summoning are not valid methods since they harm sentient beings," here one should understand there are two types of practitioners - superior and inferior. Regarding superior practitioners, even the perfection vehicle teaches this, as stated in the noble Ratnakūṭa:

"Whatever is the city's body becomes beneficial for the sugarcane field. Similarly, whatever is the fertilizer of afflictions becomes beneficial for the bodhisattva's field of enlightenment."

Likewise, there are many examples, such as the great compassionate ship captain who killed the black man with a spear and thereby purified eons of negative karma. Here too, killing and such done with hatred are prohibited. From scripture:

"Merely by harming beings..."

As stated in scripture:

"Merely by harming sentient beings,
One will not attain the siddhi of mudrā."

When embraced by skillful means, these actions are permitted. While this may be true for superior practitioners, if one objects that it is improper for inferior practitioners to engage in this path, then by that same logic, monastic discipline and teachings on emptiness would also be improper since they too can become causes of negativity when misused. If one thinks "Though improper, these still serve as a path for the inferior since they plant seeds of liberation," the same applies here as well.

Regarding the objection about "engaging carelessly in desires," one should ask: Then according to the perfection vehicle, would one be completely forbidden from eating food and making offerings to the Three Jewels? If one responds "There is no fault when done with the intention of maintaining one's body and making offerings to the Three Jewels," here too when embraced by skillful means it is permitted, while activities that distract the mind are always prohibited. 

If one objects "Then the paths would be equal," though it is true that there is no dispute regarding secret mantra since the general basis or root of the path is the same, it is superior because it clearly teaches many distinctions and easier practices. For example, just as emptiness and vastness are also taught in the śrāvaka scriptures and thereby established as Buddha's word of the Mahāyāna, similarly here too it is superior because of clearly teaching the distinctions.

3. Refuting the objection that it equals the śrāvaka path:

Here is the objection: "Although practitioners of secret mantra may have sharp faculties and achieve realization in this life or the intermediate state, since this is too quick, they will only attain an inferior result. Just as with rice that ripens too quickly like koṭa or śāli rice, here too, since it is said that śrāvakas are quickly liberated in three lifetimes, they achieve the inferior result of arhatship in three lives. But to accomplish the supreme result of buddhahood, one must engage in vast bodhisattva conduct with various difficult practices - without those, unexcelled enlightenment cannot be achieved. Therefore, even though secret mantra practitioners may have sharp faculties, since they have not engaged in vast conduct, they will achieve an inferior result like the śrāvakas."

In response, some masters explain: When it is said that secret mantra practitioners achieve realization in one life, this refers to attaining mahāmudrā siddhi at the first bhūmi, which is possible to achieve in this life due to having sharp faculties. Therefore, it is equivalent to the perfection path, since even in the perfections it is taught that upon attaining acceptance of the unborn dharmas, enlightenment can be achieved in seven days.

According to the learned master Śrī Ghoṣa: "Through the rituals of secret mantra practice, one attains the vidyādhara of mastery over life. In that very life of being a vidyādhara, buddhahood is explained to be accomplished." This indicates that when one attains immeasurable life, what contradiction could there be in also engaging in various difficult practices?

This interpretation also accords with the intent of the glorious Sampuṭa and Vajraḍāka tantras, which state that "accomplishment occurs in the life when one achieves essence extraction."

The Venerable One says: From the glorious Guhyasamāja:
"The ocean of bodhicitta,
Through that life of Vajrasattva is attained."

According to this, Master Candrakīrti explains: "The life of Vajrasattva means being free from illness, possessing longevity, and being free from obstacles. " 

In accordance with this, even with a contaminated body, if one strives with intense diligence in this very life, non-conceptual samādhi will arise. All excellent qualities of accomplishment such as miraculous powers will also manifest. When one fulfills the purposes of inconceivable beings in an instant, one also fulfills the vast conduct of bodhisattvas. As stated in the glorious Sampuṭa:

"In some cases the mind of great enlightenment,
In some cases supreme victory over māras. "

And:
"Having given the body as offering,
Afterwards engage in perfect conduct. "

Therefore, accumulations are not completed through long duration, like the sufferings of saṃsāra. Even in a short time accumulations can be completed. It is explained that by praising the Tathāgata Nakṣatrarāja with one verse and performing seven circumambulations, the accumulations of nine eons are completed. Thus one should understand that in these words of the Venerable One, the views of both earlier masters are neither contradictory nor incompatible. 2. Refuting the objection that Kriyā and Caryā are not secret mantra:
Here is the objection: "If secret mantra is superior due to the four distinctions, since Kriyā and Caryā tantras lack the distinctions of being free from confusion and accomplishing enlightenment through bliss without hardship, they would not be secret mantra. Merely being known as secret mantra cannot serve as a valid reason, since even the perfections are sometimes labeled as secret mantra, which would lead to an absurd consequence. ".

The response to this is: While all agree that without the four Buddha seals one cannot be a Buddhist path, if that were applied [too strictly], since the Noble Śrāvakas do not accept the selflessness of all phenomena, and the Mahāsāṃghikas do not accept that all conditioned things are impermanent, how could they be Buddhists? If you say these [doctrines] were not entirely unexplained to them but were taught in a concealed way for those of lesser understanding, the same applies here. Even in Kriyā and Caryā tantras, there is blessing and thus freedom from confusion, and since they allow a degree of bliss through visualization and establishment, they are also free from hardship, though these are not extensively taught there. Therefore, although their distinctions are minor compared to Mahāyoga, since they have great distinctions compared to Pāramitāyāna, they qualify as secret mantra.

3. Refuting the contradiction with the classification of piṭakas:
Here is the objection: "The sūtras state that all Buddha's teachings are included within the three piṭakas. Since you have one additional piṭaka of secret mantra, that would make four piṭakas, contradicting the sūtras."

This is not correct. The three piṭakas refer to the Pāramitāyāna teachings. Since secret mantra is extraordinary and not widely known there, it constitutes a distinct, superior category called the Vidyādhara-piṭaka, just as Mahāyāna teachings were not known in the Śrāvaka tradition.

If you object that it must still be included within the three piṭakas and twelve branches of scripture, here is how they are included: When considering scripture generally, all vehicles including secret mantra are included within what is called the "extremely extensive piṭaka." This is also stated in the Mahāyoga tantra called Mañjuśrī-māyājāla:

"Thus, in the Mahāyoga tantra called Mañjuśrī-māyājāla, it is said to be the 'Extremely Extensive Great Bodhisattva Piṭaka.' Similarly, this is stated in the Vairocana-abhisaṃbodhi and Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa. 

Regarding the three piṭakas, Paṇḍita Abhayākaragupta explains:

All three are present:
1. The Vinaya teaches discipline
2. The Sūtra teaches mind
3. The Abhidharma teaches wisdom

Some explain that since it mainly teaches non-conceptual activity, it is Abhidharma.

The Venerable One states that it belongs to the Sūtra Piṭaka, because it primarily teaches the training in higher mind, or because it teaches all three trainings. As stated in the Sūtrālaṃkāra regarding the characteristics of the three piṭakas:

1. The Vinaya is the dharma of discipline,
Due to falling, arising and lifting up,
Due to definite emergence and persons,
Due to rules and classifications.

2. The Abhidharma is due to causes,
Repetition, and realization through conquest.

3. The Sūtra is due to bases,
Characteristics, and expressing dharma meanings.

This characterization of the Sūtra matches what Ārya Asaṅga taught in the Abhidharma. Most secret mantra texts also refer to it as 'this sūtra.'

4. Some Śrāvakas who pride themselves in being Mahāyāna say: 'Although the vehicle of secret mantra is indeed an extraordinary sublime dharma, now is not the time to practice it because there are no teachers and students with the proper characteristics, and'"

Now is not the time to practice it because there are no teachers and students with the proper characteristics, and because while the benefits of maintaining [the commitments] are great, the faults of not maintaining them are severe, and because one cannot maintain the samaya commitments, and because in these degenerate times one is afflicted by many sufferings and cannot attain accomplishments. "

This is incorrect because although it may be difficult to find someone possessing all the qualifications, one can find teachers endowed with some of the characteristics of vajra masters explained in the tantras and śāstras, such as: "Steadfast, disciplined, and intelligent, patient, honest and free from deceit," and so forth. If this were not the case, since it would also be difficult to find any of the twenty-one sets of five preceptors for ordination who possess all the qualifications, ordination would also have to be rejected. And if one should not practice because the faults of not maintaining [the commitments] are severe, since this applies to all sublime Dharma, it would follow that one should not engage in any Dharma practice. If you think there are benefits just from hearing the sublime Dharma, the same applies here too. The claim that one cannot maintain the samaya commitments is also unreasonable. Just as it is easier for a fully ordained monk to maintain their vows if they can maintain the novice vows, if one maintains the three types of common bodhisattva discipline, one can also engage in secret mantra without impediment. The argument about degenerate times is also unreasonable. For precisely this reason, methods other than secret mantra cannot bring accomplishment. As stated in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa: "Furthermore, in future times at the end of the age, accomplishments cannot be attained. Understanding the Dharma in this way, all aspirations are fulfilled. " While accomplishment cannot be achieved through the Pāramitāyāna in these degenerate times, it can be achieved through secret mantra in these very degenerate times.

From the Herukaṃ Saṃbhava:

"When grasping glorious Heruka,
One will achieve in degenerate times."
